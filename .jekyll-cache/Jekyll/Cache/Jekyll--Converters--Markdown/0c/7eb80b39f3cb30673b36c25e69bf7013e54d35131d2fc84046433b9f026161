I"‡<p>This Tuesday, I attended my first event at HSBC. Due to COVID-19 and the distance, the event was hosted via Zoom. I had the opportunity to meet many of my colleagues from around the world. I am very grateful for this career opportunity at HSBC.
<br /><br />
HSBC has a blend of Western culture and Asian heritage. It was founded by a Scottish banker in Hong Kong. The international financial institution and the Asian financial centre have been appealing to me and many people for a long time. 
<br /><br />
I studied business in school, specifically Finance and Information Systems. I was accepted into the organisation as a Global Operations Graduate Trainee. I will be focusing on the bankâ€™s global operations. The two-year rotational programme will lead into a Senior Operations Manager role per HSBCâ€™s official careers website.
<br /><br />
I will dedicate my time to my job â€“my first full-time job after graduating university. This is a rare opportunity that pays an above-average salary in Guangzhou and across China.I will do my best to connect with people and cooperate with them to deliver exceptional results at the bank.

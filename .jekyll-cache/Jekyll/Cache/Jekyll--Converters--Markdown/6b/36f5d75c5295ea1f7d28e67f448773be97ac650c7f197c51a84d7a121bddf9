I"Õ<p>I tried to sign up for a Facebook account through its web portal earlier this morning. Rather than granting me access to Facebook, the platform displayed an error message, claiming that the account which ‚Äúowns‚Äù the registration email address has been disabled by Facebook.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt the first time I sign up on Facebook. Two years ago, when I was studying in the United States, I signed up for an account to share my artwork. Back then, I wasn‚Äôt sure about building a creative career. As I got more schoolwork to do, I decided to delete my account. Hence, what I don‚Äôt understand is that the previous account was deleted on my own. It wasn‚Äôt disabled. The fact that Facebook displays this message shows that there is something wrong with its systems.</p>

<p>I looked up Facebook‚Äôs help centre to see what I can do to get my email address work again. The Facebook page shows that I must submit a ‚Äúphoto ID‚Äù within ‚Äú30 days‚Äù after disablement to request for an appeal. I don‚Äôt understand why the company insists collecting photo ID‚Äôs. It appears that internet giants like Meta would seize all available opportunities to capture and abuse our data. It‚Äôs also not possible to submit an appeal at this time since that account is long gone.</p>

<p>So, I switched from 163 to Gmail in hope to set up a Facebook account. Whilst all the steps worked: I entered my details, the 5-digit pin, and ‚Ä¶ instead of signing me in, Facebook DISABLED MY ACCOUNT AT SIGN UP! I can‚Äôt believe it claims that I ‚Äúviolated Facebook Community Standards‚Äù when I did not even get access to the platform with the newly created acccount!</p>

<p>After all these, I can reasonably conclude that Facebook has some serious bugs in its systems which can endanger user data entrusted with the platform and the company that owns and operates it. As such, I have decided to add Meta Platforms, Inc. and Facebook to the Entity List with a grade B restrictions. Grade B means the usage of products and services from Meta, including Facebook, would be limited and reviewed case by case for approval.</p>

<p>The Entity List is a tool I developed to identify and manage security risks in both physical and digital worlds. Entities designated following Entity List designation and implementation rules will be subject to a string of sanctions that deprive them access to my data. After being included on the List, I will no longer use Facebook or any Meta Platforms products or services unless there is absolutely no alternative, which won‚Äôt be the case considering that Meta has some competitors and this world is so diverse.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sharing this unpleasant experience with Facebook on my website with you all to highlight the risks of using Facebook or other Meta Platforms products and services. Please, please, please exercise caution when choosing media platforms. It is highly recommended to:</p>

<p>#DeleteFacebook</p>

<p>#DeleteInstagram</p>

<p>#DeleteWhatsApp</p>

<p>#BoycottMetaPlatforms</p>

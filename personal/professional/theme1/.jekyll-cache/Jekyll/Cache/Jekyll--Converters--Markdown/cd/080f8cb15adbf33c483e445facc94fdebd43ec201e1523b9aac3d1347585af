I"˚<p>Let‚Äôs tell the truth - the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs censorship is doing a serious disservice to all the Chinese companies that are working so hard to serve the Chinese people and people around the world well.
<br /><br />
As a developer, I‚Äôve been using GitHub for a long time, but I want to support Chinese platforms. OSChina, which stands for Open-Source China, is arguably the most popular code hosting service in the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC).
<br /><br />
I registered an account on the platform and tried it out. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to drop GitHub and support Made in China, I was unable to do so because of the internet censorship. Nine out of ten times, I encountered issues related to censorship on the platform. OSChina disallowed me to upload my code files due to what it calls ‚Äúpotentially sensitive expressions‚Äù. What‚Äôs even worse is that this ambiguous error message provided me with no hint to correct the errors and make my programs work and sharable on the platform. 
<br /><br />
Usually, bad user experiences like this on Chinese platforms are not attributable to the companies themselves but the stringent, sometimes inhumane, censorship rules that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) imposes on them with the absolute authority that it secured since the founding of the PRC. 
<br /><br />
I repeat: the CCP‚Äôs censorship is the culprit behind the bad user experience and the criminal who‚Äôs making PRC companies much less attractive to customers and therefore less competitive than foreign players. Not the Chinese people who build up the platforms and provide the services. 
<br /><br />
Many people would agree with me on this issue and acknowledge this obvious truth. No one; however, especially those who have China-based investments to take care of, has the courage to speak out against these unjust rules and laws.
<br /><br />
If the CCP-controlled Chinese government continues to impose restrictions on PRC companies and limit the activities of their customers, PRC companies simply cannot and will not succeed or merit the same level of respect that global companies like Google, Apple, and Adobe receive. 
<br /><br />
The PRC government censorship is much worse than any U.S. sanction imposed on PRC companies. The censorship rules are harming PRC companies more than any foreign sanction. Many globally successful companies including Twitter, Facebook, and Google are operating without the Chinese market. They‚Äôre successful because they understand and respect the freedoms and rights that are given to every person at birth. 
<br /><br />
There‚Äôre countless PRC citizens bypassing the notorious Great Fire Wall to see what the real world is about on the global platforms that are blocked in the PRC. They look for facts that are censored and inaccessible on PRC platforms. People seek freedoms and rights whenever it is possible not because of voracity; rather, they‚Äôre simply looking for what‚Äôs taken away from them involuntarily. Every human being is entitled with these freedoms and rights.
<br /><br />
If the CCP doesn‚Äôt lift its restrictions on PRC firms. China, Inc. will never win the market not because of export restrictions but the freedoms-and-rights-killing rules that the Chinese government imposes on them.

I"¢<p>I visited a number of companies that provide training on storytelling, animation and filmmaking in the past several days. Iâ€™m doing so in support of the art and design programme launched earlier this month.</p>

<p>My goal is to become an independent filmmaker. I want to animate and create my own entertainment media brand as a freelancer. Animation has been my dream since at an early age. I enjoyed watching cartoons like other kids, and it has been my goal to create my own animated stories that bring laughter to all corners of the world. This dream starts with grasping the basics of storytelling, animation and filmmaking.</p>

<p>China is a country with rich history and remarkable civilisation. We have a lot of programmes available here to acquire this knowledge and skills. I will release a table comparing and contrasting all the companies I visited and pick a starting point to launch this exciting journey.</p>

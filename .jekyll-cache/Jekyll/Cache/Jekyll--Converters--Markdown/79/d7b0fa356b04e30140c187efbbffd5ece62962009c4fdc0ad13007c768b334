<p>The world is such a diverse place. We simply canâ€™t expect every person to hold the same opinion on every issue. Therefore, we must
learn to respect and understand othersâ€™ perspectives whilst defending our own positions.</p>

<p>Having spent four years in the United States, thisâ€™s one of the most valuable lessons I learned on that journey. Western and Oriental
civilisations are different in a lot of ways. Our histories shape the way we think and act. The United States and China have different 
opinions on a wide range of issues spanning politics, technology and religions, etc. These differences are playing a pivotal role in 
shaping the U.S.-China relationship and the world order.</p>

<p>Whilst I made a lot of friends while I was studying there, we held different opinions on a lot of social issues. Coming from
a Communist society, itâ€™s hard to convince me that God exists with just a few theology lectures. As a PRC citizen studying
abroad, I also got defensive when Americans claimed that the coronavirus was man-made and released from a virology lab in 
Wuhan, blaming my country for this pandemic.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important to be a good listener and defender at the same time. Being a good listener means to stay calm and process the information
that others present. We shall listen with the intent to understand but not to persuade others to buy into our own perspectives. Whilst we 
donâ€™t necessarily have to accept othersâ€™ ideas, we should still listen, think critically, and decide if theyâ€™re making valid points. Itâ€™s 
important to show respect so that we can keep the conversation healthy and fruitful. We should not assume everyone should hold the same 
opinion although some ideas may sound insane or even offensive.
ideas sound.</p>

<p>We must also be fearless defenders. We must keep faith in our beliefs and the decisions we make. If weâ€™re certain that we made valid points 
and our	opinions are supported by reasoning, then we should defend them â€“ explain clearly how we reached the conclusions and why 
we hold these opinions. We need to gather ideas from different sources to broaden our horizens, learn from differences, and make sure 
that our perspectives are heard, shared and discussed in the conversations.</p>

<p>If we believe in our ideas while others continue to refuse to accept them, we should give them some time and keep in mind that weâ€™re not the
ultimate authority. Every person has the right to process information and formulate their own stances. Itâ€™s time to pause and move on to 
other topics. Itâ€™s more persuasive and powerful to prove our ideas with bold actions than having endless debates and disagreements.</p>

I"º<p>Since June 2021, Iâ€™ve returned to and fully integrated into the Chinese society. Chinese is the declared official language of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. There are more Chinese visitors than before because of my location change. Therefore, itâ€™s time to introduce Chinese language support to this website.</p>

<p>Those who have browsed through the entire website may have noticed that Iâ€™ve already added Chinese language support some weeks ago. Visitors can visit resources in the Chinese language on <a href="/resources/translations/zh-cn/">this page</a>. This page provides Simplified Chinese resources, including resources translated into Chinese from other languages.</p>

<p>In addition, Iâ€™m building a multilingual website in replacement of the current website. The new website will be responsive, mobile-first and support multiple languages. I will provide another update when the new website becomes available to the public.</p>

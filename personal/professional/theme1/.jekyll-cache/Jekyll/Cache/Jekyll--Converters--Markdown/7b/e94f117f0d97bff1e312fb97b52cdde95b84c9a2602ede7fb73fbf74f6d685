<p>I believe careers should be mission-driven. This is how we can have a clear direction and objective to build a rewarding and fulfilling career.</p>

<p>Elon Musk founded Tesla and SpaceX on a mission to save mankind; Jeffrey Katzenberg founded DreamWorks SKG on a mission to bring laughter to every corner of the planet; HSBC, the global bank, is operating on the mission of opening opportunities for people and organisations, etc.</p>

<p>Hence, career development and job search are just about exploring paths to fulfil the mission. We need to work in areas where we can fulfil our mission, unleash our potential. This type of work will be most rewarding and gratifying.</p>

<p>As a finance and information systems graduate, I set the goal to integrate these skills to create value fresh out of college. I didnâ€™t think too much about mission. This is how I landed this job on HSBCâ€™s Global Operations Graduate Programme. However, as I spend more time in operations, I found it not very satisfying. I feel like there is something big missing despite all the financial and non-financial benefits that the bank offers.</p>

<p>I think the missing part is a mission. In banking operations, we process data and files. Sometimes we review business processes to streamline a bit. Most of the work in operations are non-technical exept for data analysis and automation projects. What Iâ€™m feeling is that sometimes I donâ€™t get to use my finance and IT skills. Iâ€™m given simple, repetitive and labour-intensive tasks to do. This work is critical to the bank, but I donâ€™t feel like it is as important to me because there isnâ€™t much learning. Itâ€™s all about working and delivering.</p>

<p>When I watched a documentary about the former Group Chief Executive John Flint on HSBCâ€™s corporate intranet, I found a book titled How to be Happy at Work on the CEOâ€™s desk, I was eager to find out what the book is about. It offered to cover the missing part of my career, which is a mission. When you have a clear mission in mind, and you work your ass off, there is nothing that can stop you, whether that be financial instability or other kinds of pressure. Of course, we donâ€™t want to be in those situations, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>The more time I spend in operations doing these chores, I get more bored. The book says borden is a symptom - an expression of being underemployed. Itâ€™s true. This is exactly what Iâ€™m feeling. Hence, in the next couple of hours, I will revamp the <a href="/uploads/CP2021-2023.pdf">Career Plan</a> to include a clearer mission. I will redesign the plan to align with the mission and ensure that every step on the way contributes to the fulfilling of this mission.</p>

I"£<p>When I said making web development a lifetime passion, I was serious. I canâ€™t hide or deny my passions for the Web, so I accept that it is my lifetime passion.</p>

<p>I wrote a series of articles explaining how I want to succeed on the Web. I want to strengthen my full-stack skills to be able to build static sites with Jekyll, dynamic sites with WordPress and more sophisticated web-based applications with Python Django.</p>

<p>To achieve these objectives, I must act. I must take action to acquire knowledge and skills in CSS and JavaScript, I must devote more time to learning WordPress and Django, and indeed I should return to the basics to construct a design system with both front-and back-end features to deepen my understanding of web development.</p>

<p>In taking up this Web challenge, Iâ€™ve created an Action Plan to detail the steps that I must take to succeed as a professional web developer. Iâ€™ve modified the frontpage of this website and linked the document there under the Sample Projects section.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I will stick to this plan and take meaningful action toward the achievement of these objectives and goals. This will be a fruitful learning experience, and Iâ€™m looking forward to all the surprises and challenges coming ahead!</p>

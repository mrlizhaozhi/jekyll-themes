Jardine Matheson has been one of my favourite companies since before my university graduation. This's also the only company that I tried and failed two times. Jardines has
a highly-selective executive trainee scheme that offers recent graduates with less than two years of full-time experience an opportunity to build a career
across two or more industries within the group. 
<br /><br />
Jardines is the largest employer in Hong Kong and has been in business for nearly 200 years. Last year, when I was still a university senior, I applied to the programme but
was placed on the final interview waitlist after completing two rounds of online assessments. This year, just a few weeks ago, I applied again. Yesterday, I received my 
second rejection letter. This time, I was not even considered for the final round.
<br /><br />
I learned a few lessons from this shameful experience. First, there is no guarantee that you will pass an interview even though it is your second attempt. When I received the
assessments, I was excited and optimistic that I could win because the questions were unchanged. Therefore, I had a very high expectation for myself but also started to not 
taking the assessments seriously considering that this is my second time answering the questions. In hindsight, I should have treated the assessments seriously just as I did in the last time.
<br /><br />
Second, finish what you started with determination and caution. After getting shortlisted to take the second assessment, I was very happy and started to think I had a 
higher chance to win. Unfortunately, I allowed that milestone to take away my energy and patience. I didn't devote as much time and effort to the second assessment
as I did to the first assessment.
<br /><br />
Therefore, whilst I'm very disappointed to be rejected twice by Jardine Matheson, I also learned some valuable lessons from these failures.

Yesterday (29 July 2022), I lost access to Microsoft 365 - the classic Microsoft office software suit. I’ve been using Microsoft 365 since I bought my first laptop four years ago to attend university in the United States. The software suit was offered free to students by the university I attended. Graduates were given one-year extension to continue to use the software package after leaving the university.

Yesterday was the last day I got to use Microsoft 365 freely offered by my alma mater. Almost immediately after the disablement of my university email account (which runs on Outlook and is an enterprise Microsoft account), all the software associated with the account blocked me out because the subscription went away with the account. 

I’ve gotten so used to Microsoft Office software, so I was a bit shocked and disappointed after realising that I will no longer have access to these free and easy to use software without paying for a subscription. On the other hand, this presents an opportunity to try out non-Microsoft solutions in the workplace.

Most people are not aware of this fact but WPS Office - a free alternative to Microsoft Office - came out years before Microsoft launched the service. WPS is made in China by publicly listed software company Kingsoft. WPS Office has grown popularity in China over years. Now an increasing number of Chinese and foreign companies are using WPS rather than Microsoft Office because of its powerful features and low price. Individuals can use the suit for free forever without ever having to pay a subscription fee. This sets the software package apart from its competitors. I created a WPS account after returning home from the United States to prepare for disconnection from Microsoft services. Today is the day. It’s time to use Chinese.

In addition to WPS, there’re other alternatives as well such as Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Both of which are free and open-source software designed to rival Microsoft Office suit software. These software are accepted into global markets, and as more people use them, the better these open-source software projects get. 

In the next couple of days, I will try out these alternatives. There is a good chance; however, that I will stick to WPS Office because it’s homemade. As a Chinese citizen, I’m proud of supporting the People’s Republic of China through the lens of commerce. If more of us use Made in China, it will get better and become more competitive players on the global stage.

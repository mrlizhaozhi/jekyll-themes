I"÷<p>The highly anticipated Beijing Winter Olympics and Chinese New Year are approaching in less than five days. Iâ€™ve updated the front page of this website to encourage you to watch the games and cheer for Team China.</p>

<p>Both of these are important events for China and the Chinese people. 2022 is the year of tiger. Tiger is the king of the animal kingdom - a symbol of strength and prosperity. As we come close to the Chinese New Year on the 1st of February, Iâ€™m also wrapping up my work on my first HSBC Graduate Programme rotation. Iâ€™m looking forward to the meeting with my next line manager and joining the Business Management team upon returning from Chinese New Year celebrations.</p>

<p>2021 was a tough year for many. COVID-19 variants continue to storm across the globe. We must keep our faith in science and technology and collaboration across the world. We must continue to exercise social distancing and get vaccinated for ourselves, our friends, family and those who we care about. We must act to send a clear message to the plague - We will defeat the virus and restore normality.</p>

<p>In the next couple of days, I will continue to update this website to publish the delayed guidelines on project management, send out my wishes to friends and family and lay out a strategy for building a bright, rewarding long-term career.</p>

<p>There are a couple of challenges and opportunities that Iâ€™m looking forward to. Justin Wang, a friend of mine from college, introduced me to a commercial web project. This opportunity can earn me as much as $2,000 whilst shoring up my development skills. P&amp;G, Mars and other FMCG giants will kick start their campus recruiting efforts in March. This presents another opportunity for me to seek a more financially and professionally rewarding career.</p>

<p>2022 is a critical year for me. Itâ€™s year for me to figure out my raison dâ€™etre and take bold action towards achieving my long-term academic and career goals. This year will be a year of change. Itâ€™s up to me to seize every available opportunity to thrive.  I will save my other thoughts in a later post.</p>

<p>Please visit my website to watch Beijing 2022 games and learn more about Chinese New Year. In 2022, I will continue to think and share my ideas.</p>

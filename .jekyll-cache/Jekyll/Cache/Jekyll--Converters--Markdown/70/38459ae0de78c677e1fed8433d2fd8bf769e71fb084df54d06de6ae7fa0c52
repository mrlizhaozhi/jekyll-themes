I"ü<p>LinkedIn is a professional social networking service operated by Microsoft Corporation. The service enables global engagement between professionals across academia, business, non-profit and public sectors. The service was one of the few remaining American social networks in Mainland China.</p>

<p>In December 2021, Microsoft announced the sunset of LinkedInâ€™s China edition and introduced a new app called InCareer. Unlike LinkedIn which prioritises the social elements in careers, InCareer is a job board application on which companies can publish job openings and job seekers can apply to the jobs. The application doesnâ€™t have social media support like LinkedIn.</p>

<p>LinkedIn users can follow companies and connect with professionals from around the world, catch up with the latest updates from the companies and people in their networks and communicate with each other in chatrooms. All of these features that set LinkedIn apart from its competitors are gone with the launch of InCareer in Mainland China.</p>

<p>Whilst studying in the United States, I had a class in which the professor spent half of the lecture instructing students to set up their LinkedIn profiles, connect with other students and professionals and search and apply for jobs. LinkedIn is indeed a great tool for professional social networking. Prominent companies post updates and jobs on the platform and the feeds are tailored to fit usersâ€™ preferences. It has been the only bridge connecting me with a few of my friends in the United States and China because it was the only accessible foreign social media in China.</p>

<p>After the removal of LinkedIn, InCareer became the only download option in Chinese app stores. All the networking features are gone, including news updates and overseas job opportunities from companies. It has also become much harder to find and follow companies and connect with people. Without the social elements that LinkedIn prioritised, the update to InCareer has significantly diminished the serviceâ€™s value.</p>

<p>Even with the once available social media support, the intrinsic value of LinkedIn is still in question. Whilst I connected with some 220 professionals, most of them were connected during or after networking events. I never got to engage with them and get to know them personally. Most connections just sit there, adding no value to career research and job application. Companies not only post updates and host career talks on LinkedIn but also on other social media platforms such as WeChat, Twitter, Bilibili and YouTube.</p>

<p>Now, with even less useful features, I believe itâ€™s time to reevaluate the serviceâ€™s value and its future. This isnâ€™t my first time creating a LinkedIn account. With my long-term career residing in China and better domestic alternatives available, Iâ€™m finding other ways to remain connected with my friends instead of using LinkedIn or its InCareer application. I may delete my account and remove all data from the platform and will not return to this service before June 2022.</p>

I"h<p>I have determined that animation is a passion of mine. Now it’s time to take bold action to develop this passion and take it to the next level.</p>

<p>Animation used to be expensive and inaccessible. The software, hardware and other materials required to produce animated videos are unaffordable to a lot of people. With free and open-source software become available in this field, animation has become much more accessible.</p>

<p>I’m interested in animation because it is creative, aesthetic and entertaining. I consider animation a source of strength, resilience and power because it can bring people closer together and create laughter in this unpredictable, sometimes intimidating and unpleasant, world.</p>

<p>To facilitate the development of this passion, I have created the Art and Design Programme which includes an animation curriculum. I have gathered resources for learning and making animation. These include textbooks, forum articles, video tutorials, free and open-source animation and editing software, and I’m considering signing up for an art programme. I’m determined to master the nuts and bolts of animation, combining design with captivating stories to create heart-warming experience for audiences worldwide through the medium of character animation.</p>

<p>I plan to use these resources to learn the full process of producing theatre-grade feature animation. This includes ideation, storytelling, design, and animation, etc. I will learn to write stories by reading books, storyboard and design in Krita, and animate in Pencil2D. I will then use OpenShot to edit finished animated films.</p>

<p>I understand that this will take a lot of time and efforts, but this hard work will be rewarding. As I make progress following the Action Plan, I will release updates on this website. Please stay tunned for more exciting news about my first animated film!</p>

I"/<p>Iâ€™ve been blogging for three years now. Writing is a good way to record and share ideas. It helps me stay calm, rational and logical. Writing makes articulation and exchange happen. Quality writing communicates ideas effectively whilst lousy writing can lead to misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Grammatical errors, typos and other forms of errors are not uncommon in my published blog posts. These errors discredit my content and make my articles harder to comprehend. To enhance the quality of writing, necessary changes must take place.</p>

<p>Proofreading is a proven strategy for improving writing quality. At universities, professors would always recommend students to proofread their papers two, three times before submitting for grading. By proofreading, authors can check the logic of their writing and catch easily identifiable flaws.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I will proofread each article before I make it public on this website. Ensuring the quality of writing is a responsibility of all authors. All writers shall be held to account for their work quality.</p>

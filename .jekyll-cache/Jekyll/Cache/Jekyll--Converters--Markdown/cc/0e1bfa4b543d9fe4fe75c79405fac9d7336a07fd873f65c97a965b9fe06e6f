WEB DEVELOPMENT	Web Design System: 			I announced in a published blog post that I'm working on the development of a web design system for application		development. This system includes commonly used web components, code for implementing the components, and detailed		documentation instructing users on how to use the tools that the system provides to build web-based applications. 	 			The system is designed to be comprehensive. It will provide resources for building both front-and back-end features. 		The system will be used in the next iteration of this website as well as other web-based application projects. The 		system has been made available on this website.

Many websites -- from		government, business to personal websites -- run on WordPress. As a web developer, I'm committed to acquiring the skills 		in WordPress theme development. Knowing WordPress will help me build better web applications for clients. 	 			I started this journey at the beginning of February 2022. I've been trying to turn one of my template designs into a 		fully functional WordPress website. I've made good progress on this initiative. Once I master the basics of WordPress 		theme development, I will publish this new website. 	 	Jekyll Theme: 			Jekyll is an excellent static site generator that enables developers to build stunning static websites from 		markdown files. Jekyll uses Ruby and Liquid to create reusable templates, allowing users to focus on the actual		content and build webpages easily. This tool helps minimise errors from manual handling of HTML code. 	 "

This magazine will combine all my hobbies and serve as a platform to communicate with the outside world.

This updated Action Plan will overwrite and succeed the older version that shall be treated as the guidebook for learning web development knowledge and skills. The document is divided into six chapters. The first chapter sets the objective of the Action Plan and offers a high-level glance of the document structure. The second chapter explains why is it meaningful and important to acquire web development skills to design web-based applications and build a full-stack web design system. The third chapter sets learning objectives in the technology, design, functionality and analytics components of web applications. The fourth chapter explains how the Plan will measure success. The fifth chapter details how the Action Plan will achieve these objectives through a combination of learning methods. Finally, the sixth chapter summarises the Plan and outlines implementation rules. In addition to the above chapters, the document includes two appendix attachments that offer tools to track progress and measure the effectiveness of the Plan. This document is made available in Simplified Chinese. You can download the PDF-converted Action Plan and the two attachments below.

The Action Plan will be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound. The Plan will incorporate this model to refine the instructions and rules to make sure that tangible outcomes will be achieved following the Plan. The Plan will also include a new section called Implementation, which specifies how to implement the plan and what consequences will have for failing to meet targets.

    "body": "2022/08/09 - I just made an irreversable decision which I hope that I won’t regret. I decided to permanently delete all other themes I designed for good. This means, I will stick with the current web design a bit longer before this website switches with a new look. I made this decision because I couldn’t control my impulse to jump between themes. As discussed in a post published last year, it is now better for me to stick around one theme and work to make it perfect than switching between themes constantly to strengthen my web development skills. Now it’s more practical for me to complete the announced full-stack design system than building just another website theme. By deleting other unused themes, I’m killing this impulse of moving around. This helps me focus on improving the current theme and put more time and effort in completing the development of the design system. An open-source full-stack design system is way more valuable and practical for fellow developers than pre-built themes that are sometimes difficult to modify and debug. Now with all those themes retired, I will focus 100% on improving the current theme and finish building the long-awaited design system. "

    "body": "2022/08/03 - When it comes to safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese Communist Party has gotten it absolutely right to protest U. S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s visit of the Taiwan Province, but it should do more to show the People’s Republic of China’s resolve to confront separatism and foreign interference. Long before Pelosi landed in Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry had protested multiple times calling for the United States of America to cancel the visit with warnings of retaliation. Despite all these diplomatic efforts, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House and the 3rd ranking member in the line of power of America, landed in Taiwan and met with Tsai Ing-wen. In response to this insult on China’s vital national interest, the Chinese government took a whole-of-government approach to respond to the engagement between high-level Taiwan and U. S. officials. These included visa restrictions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, import and export restrictions from the Ministry of Commerce and unprecedented military drills from the Chinese People’s Liberation Army of the Ministry of National Defence, as well as sanctions imposed by the State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office. This sanction package sends a clear message to the Democractic Progressive Party in Taiwan and the United States that secession has no place in China. However, most of these countermeasures are harming Taiwan civilians with little impact on the ruling political party DPP and the United States authority. Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan is unprecedented. As a high-ranking U. S. official, whether executive, legislative and judicial branches are separated or not, her visit to Taiwan is a serious violation of the One-China policy. There is only one China in the world, so is there only one One-China policy that is valid. It is the policy introduced by the People’s Republic of China, not the self-made U. S. version or other editions. Considering the fact that China has warned multiple times of consequences and urged Pelosi not to visit Taiwan, her trip to Taiwan is Pelosi’s choice. Hence, it is reasonable for China to impose sanctions on the U. S. Speaker of the House, fellow U. S. officials who joined the trip, as well as U. S. military persons who are on the U. S. aircraft carrier near Taiwan. Sanctioning a high-ranking U. S. official would send a clear and strong message to Washington D. C. that no one is above China’s resolve to safteguard its interests and security, and the People’s Republic of China is unafraid of challenging those who seek to harm with forceful response regardless of their identities.

Shuhua is an acclaimed education service company that specialises in art education. I’m ecstatic to kick off this wonderous learning journey and move one step forward towards the dream of becoming an animation director. In this course, I will learn from the basics of drawing to advanced design in character animation. This course comprehensively covers everything I need to be a qualified animation artist. I must put in time and effort to succeed in this paid course. I must seize all resources and opportunities to learn and practise. I must set up an art studio at home to practise drawing whenever I can. This is how I can make progress and become a better artist. Drawing is fundamental to animation. I need to master drawing and design before moving into animation. This is how it works, so I must concentrate on drawing and storytelling now before moving on to learning animation. I have every confidence in my ability to succeed in the course and realise my ambitions in animation. "

    "body": "2022/07/30 - The Office of Li Zhaozhi has launched the Free and Open Internet Programme to counter unjustified, politically-driven government censorship. A free and open internet is good for all. Government officials can use it as a forum to discuss and formulate public-serving policies, scholars can use it to query and gather useful data and information to support research and others can use it to form communities and stay connected. The Free and Open Internet Programme is designed to secure freedom and openness on the internet. This is achieved through public advocacy, development and adoption of firewall bypassing tools such as virtual private network (VPN), shadowsocks and v2ray applications, and other promotional activities designed to educate the public on the importance of a free and open internet as well as ways to get access to this internet from all corners of the world. The Programme is against unjustified, politically-driven censorship usually carried out by government such as those imposed by the Chinese Communist Party’s government of the People’s Republic of China. Through the Free and Open Internet Programme, people worldwide will learn about the dangers of censorship and create tools to secure their freedoms and rights in the digital world. "

    "body": "2022/07/30 - Yesterday (29 July 2022), I lost access to Microsoft 365 - the classic Microsoft office software suit. I’ve been using Microsoft 365 since I bought my first laptop four years ago to attend university in the United States. The software suit was offered free to students by the university I attended. Graduates were given one-year extension to continue to use the software package after leaving the university. Yesterday was the last day I got to use Microsoft 365 freely offered by my alma mater. Almost immediately after the disablement of my university email account (which runs on Outlook and is an enterprise Microsoft account), all the software associated with the account blocked me out because the subscription went away with the account. I’ve gotten so used to Microsoft Office software, so I was a bit shocked and disappointed after realising that I will no longer have access to these free and easy to use software without paying for a subscription. On the other hand, this presents an opportunity to try out non-Microsoft solutions in the workplace. Most people are not aware of this fact but WPS Office - a free alternative to Microsoft Office - came out years before Microsoft launched the service. WPS is made in China by publicly listed software company Kingsoft. WPS Office has grown popularity in China over years. Now an increasing number of Chinese and foreign companies are using WPS rather than Microsoft Office because of its powerful features and low price. Individuals can use the suit for free forever without ever having to pay a subscription fee. This sets the software package apart from its competitors. I created a WPS account after returning home from the United States to prepare for disconnection from Microsoft services. Today is the day. It’s time to use Chinese. In addition to WPS, there’re other alternatives as well such as Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Both of which are free and open-source software designed to rival Microsoft Office suit software. These software are accepted into global markets, and as more people use them, the better these open-source software projects get. In the next couple of days, I will try out these alternatives. There is a good chance; however, that I will stick to WPS Office because it’s homemade. As a Chinese citizen, I’m proud of supporting the People’s Republic of China through the lens of commerce. If more of us use Made in China, it will get better and become more competitive players on the global stage. "

    "body": "2022/07/29 - I started using DewVPN a few years ago when I was studying in the United States. Every summer, when I return home in China, it becomes a headache for me to access the free and open global internet inside the Chinese government’s Great Firewall. American internet services such as YouTube, Google and Twitter are filled with useful learning resources that are not available on Chinese services, yet all these global internet services are blocked by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) inside the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The CCP adopts one of the most reckless censorship machines in the world that blocks countless foreign websites and applications. PRC citizens are not allowed to visit these blocked websites and applications and Chinese alternatives are highly restrictive. VPN’s have been the primary channels for residents in the PRC to access the free, open and uncensored global Web. There’re many reasons for PRC residents to access the global Web – students who wish to study abroad need it for information and learning support, professionals working at multinational companies need access for day-to-day business, researchers need access to databases and papers to aid their studies, and even the CCP needs access to blocked Western sites to promote a positive image of the PRC and its governing model and foreign affairs initiatives, etc. Sometimes without a VPN, GitHub can’t be accessed and this website can’t be maintained. There is no good reason to restrict access to the global internet. DewVPN is operated by Grand Media Ltd incorporated in British Virgin Islands. It is offered free of charge with military-grade encryption, making it difficult for governments to block its traffics. The app has been working great until yesterday when the app stopped connecting and this morning the official website went down completely. At the time of this writing, the service hasn’t been restored. It’s unclear if it will make a comeback at all. Internet freedom is a critical backbone of the modern digital economy. All members of society need equal access to information. They have the right to access, process information and make judgements on their own. The fight for freedom on China’s internet must continue. I have no doubt that more people will join this glorious battle. "

    "body": "2022/07/24 - It’s been at least two weeks since I created an account on Instagram, which was immediately banned by the platform. I’ve sent at least three appeals to request for the reinstation of the arbitrarily disabled account. Most email communications were not followed, and the account remains blocked at the time of this writing. I received a message from the Instagram team last week claiming that the photo they asked me to send over was inadequate for them to confirm my identity. First of all, I just created the account, so there’s no way that they can confirm I’m the account owner with my photo and hand-written note because I didn’t get a chance to access and use the account. This account is pretty much blank. Also, it’s unreasonable for Instagram to request this photo as part of the process to have a mistakenly disabled account reinstated. A facial image and hand-written note can reveal a lot of information of a person. It’s no secret that Meta has been doing research on AI which includes facial recognition and other technologies that can threaten users’ privacy and security on and offline. In fact, Meta has been heavily scrutinised and fined for opaque data acquisition rules. It would be no surprise that Meta’s Instagram is keeping all these images for purposes other than confirming the identity of an account owner considering that there isn’t footprint on the account. As such, I have determined that this mandatory submission of personal facial images is a coersion that Meta is conducting in sharp contrast of users’ interests, privacy and security. I will continue to actively approach the Instagram team to get my account back and have it deleted permenantly so that my email address and other critical data are not exposed to the thugs at Meta. "

Rather than granting me access to Facebook, the platform displayed an error message, claiming that the account which “owns” the registration email address has been disabled by Facebook. This isn’t the first time I sign up on Facebook. Two years ago, when I was studying in the United States, I signed up for an account to share my artwork. Back then, I wasn’t sure about building a creative career. As I got more schoolwork to do, I decided to delete my account. Hence, what I don’t understand is that the previous account was deleted on my own. It wasn’t disabled. The fact that Facebook displays this message shows that there is something wrong with its systems. I looked up Facebook’s help centre to see what I can do to get my email address work again. The Facebook page shows that I must submit a “photo ID” within “30 days” after disablement to request for an appeal. I don’t understand why the company insists collecting photo ID’s. It appears that internet giants like Meta would seize all available opportunities to capture and abuse our data. It’s also not possible to submit an appeal at this time since that account is long gone. So, I switched from 163 to Gmail in hope to set up a Facebook account. Whilst all the steps worked: I entered my details, the 5-digit pin, and … instead of signing me in, Facebook DISABLED MY ACCOUNT AT SIGN UP! I can’t believe it claims that I “violated Facebook Community Standards” when I did not even get access to the platform with the newly created acccount! After all these, I can reasonably conclude that Facebook has some serious bugs in its systems which can endanger user data entrusted with the platform and the company that owns and operates it. As such, I have decided to add Meta Platforms, Inc. and Facebook to the Entity List with a grade B restrictions. Grade B means the usage of products and services from Meta, including Facebook, would be limited and reviewed case by case for approval. The Entity List is a tool I developed to identify and manage security risks in both physical and digital worlds. Entities designated following Entity List designation and implementation rules will be subject to a string of sanctions that deprive them access to my data. After being included on the List, I will no longer use Facebook or any Meta Platforms products or services unless there is absolutely no alternative, which won’t be the case considering that Meta has some competitors and this world is so diverse. I’m sharing this unpleasant experience with Facebook on my website with you all to highlight the risks of using Facebook or other Meta Platforms products and services. Please, please, please exercise caution when choosing media platforms. It is highly recommended to: #DeleteFacebook #DeleteInstagram #DeleteWhatsApp #BoycottMetaPlatforms "

I have also improved the website’s accessibility support for Microsoft’s retired Internet Explorer 11 browser. All these efforts are aiming at building a better website accessible to the widest possible audience. These changes also reflect my ambitions in career development, data analytics, science and technology and art and design. I strive to be a mission-oriented, value-driven person. So I renovated the About section to highlight my mission, values and strategy. As the acquisition of STEM skills becomes more important, I updated the Research section to focus my efforts on web development, data science and artificial intelligence. These technologies will have a great impact on my career. I have as well edited the Issues section to divide it up into Careers, Growth, Networking, and Others. I believe it’s critical to understand where I’m falling short and concentrate on solving these issues. Finally, I launched the Art and Design Studio to produce comics, fictions, and animation. I believe art and design are a source of strength in times of uncertainty and depression. As I continue to update the website, I will publish more useful information. I’m in the process of finishing up About, Issues, and Research sections and renovating the blogs section. I plan to draw a clearer boundry between news and blogs.

With free and open-source software become available in this field, animation has become much more accessible. I’m interested in animation because it is creative, aesthetic and entertaining. I consider animation a source of strength, resilience and power because it can bring people closer together and create laughter in this unpredictable, sometimes intimidating and unpleasant, world. To facilitate the development of this passion, I have created the Art and Design Programme which includes an animation curriculum. I have gathered resources for learning and making animation. These include textbooks, forum articles, video tutorials, free and open-source animation and editing software, and I’m considering signing up for an art programme. I’m determined to master the nuts and bolts of animation, combining design with captivating stories to create heart-warming experience for audiences worldwide through the medium of character animation. I plan to use these resources to learn the full process of producing theatre-grade feature animation. This includes ideation, storytelling, design, and animation, etc. I will learn to write stories by reading books, storyboard and design in Krita, and animate in Pencil2D.

Hobbies can be relevant to our professions, our interests or our sense of responsibility for people around us and society, etc. When we develop these hobbies, we are making our life more enjoyable and fruitful. Life is short, so we’d better have something to do for ourselves after stressful work hours. Hobbies are what we do solely for ourselves. I’m glad to share that after months, or even years, of search, I can finally announce that web development and character animation are my hobbies. These hobbies can bring me joy, relief me from burden, best of all, they can be developed in careers should I invest in time and effort to sharpen my skills. I love web development because it gives me a sense of accomplishment – something I consider critical because I need this to boost my self-esteem. It makes me feel that all the hard work worth it. Moving forward, I will dive deep into the field. I must roll out action plans to sharpen my Web skills, enhance the website that I built, and complete and release the full-stack web design system announced at the beginning of 2022 no matter how much time and effort it takes. Should I successfully complete these ambitious projects, I will more likely be able to secure commercial contracts and become a well-paid, reputable freelance web developer. Character animation is also my hobby. I love it because it’s creative, aesthetic, and entertaining. I fell in love with cartoons just as other kids in childhood. I wanted to be an animator after growing up when I was young. This dream still lives inside me, and it has a shot to become a reality. As COVID-19, the Ukraine crisis, and economic distress make this world more negative and unpredictable, we need sources of hope, faith and positivity. I have no doubt that animation is one such much-needed sources of power. Animation is a comprehensive form of the arts. It comprises design, music, and storytelling to deliver amazing, unforgettable experiences and messages. It brings families closer together and laughter to our world. It is also proven that independent films are usually more successful than commercial films in terms of creativity. As the Chinese animation industry continues to make breakthroughs, independent animation will have a pivotal role to play in revitalising this important sector. I have decided to invest in time and effort to refresh my art and design skills. I want to put these skills into practice to bring joy to my audience. After identifying hobbies, it is vital to keep developing them. This process will be a rewarding, enjoyable one because hobbies are about what we like and care. It is something that we take personally and we do it voluntarily not because we are asked to do so as at work. I encourage you all to explore hobbies, get to know yourselves, and reserve time and energy to develop these hobbies. "

As you move far and far away from academia, your experience will be the primary basis on which companies determine what roles you can fit. Hence, it’s critical to start right - get into the field and role that you want to secure a prosperous future. Career goals should be shaped by your passions, not titles, employers, or others. When you’re interested in your work, you’re more likely than not putting more efforts to work out solutions - grow, excel, and advance in your career. When you are happy, you deliver higher quality work. Your client, colleagues, and managers will be pleased as well. Securing the right offer starts with applications. Concerned by failure, candidates tend to lean in favour of the recruiting company in job applications and screening processes. Oftentimes, they apply for jobs that they lack an adequate level of understanding and craft resumes to fit the job requirements. Whilst this effort may turn out successful in terms of getting employment, it is not the right strategy to build a career that rewards and lasts. If you’re interested in business intelligence, then you should only apply for roles that are relevant. The SMART model is applicable to career objectives as well. The roles that you sign up for should be relevant to your passions.

We must remember those who suffered and not to repeat this tragic history. Today, in the North, NATO allies continue to label the People’s Republic of China a “Strategic Competitor”, echoing Washington D. C. ’s unfounded claims and conspiracies, disseminating disinformation about China’s missions. NATO seeks to expand beyond its current geographical zone to encompass the rest of Europe and stretch into Asia. This expansionist agenda has become a trigger in the ongoing military conflict between the Kremlin in Russia and the regime in Ukraine. Might can’t make right. Whilst the United States and NATO keeps “safeguarding the rules-based international order” a mantra, we must see the truth and keep those who seek harm out of our regions. Our hearts go to those who suffered and murdered in the NATO bombardment. China should always be a force for good to deescalate tensions through meaningful dialogues and other peaceful means.

Here is the roadmap:    As the first step, I should acquire knowledge and skills in front-end development, learning to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and their frameworks and libraries to build stunning web pages.     After learning the front, I should start learning the back. I should start by learning PHP, Python, their respective frameworks and libraries and content management systems such as Drupal and WordPress to build database-driven websites and applications.

    "body": "2022/04/12 - 本文发布在中文博客。 Foundations of Artificial Intelligence Learning Plan: Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrating into our workspace and life. This technology will lead the revolution across hundreds and thousands of sectors, enabling the progression of human society. From academia to industry, AI has become a trending word. Scientists and engineers continuously develop new AI technologies. These technologies have brought far-reaching impact to multiple fields from transport, agriculture, healthcare, to manufacturing. Autonomous driving and intelligent transport are enabling more people to get on the roads whilst easing traffic congestion. Drones carrying image recognition and intelligent navigation technologies make seeding and harvesting easier. AI can also be used to analyse viruses to design effective vaccines, assure product quality, and automate production lines. One after another, cases have illustrated the bright prospects of AI. The mastering of AI fundamentals and applications has emerged into a core competency. Introduction: The overarching purpose of this course is to introduce AI, including commonly used technologies and applications. We will learn through a series of cases, engaging in a range of activities such as reading, watching, analyses, and exercises to grasp AI from multiple angles. We will leverage the free resources offered on the PaddlePaddle AI Studio platform to learn the basics of AI and utilize the Chinese-made deep learning framework PaddlePaddle to train simple AI models. We will also use other resources to systematically learn AI. In addition to domestic deep learning frameworks such as Baidu’s PaddlePaddle and Megvii’s MegEngine, there’re Google’s TensorFlow and Meta’s PyTorch. The research and development of AI have become an area of fierce competition between China and the United States. As we support Chinese technology, we must also keep an open mind to learn foreign technology. Due to time constraints, this course will only cover Baidu’s PaddlePaddle. Students who participate in this course are expected to have a grasp of Python programming. Resources: This course will use a variety of resources to learn AI basics and applications. Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Business, Education, and Healthcare is the textbook of this course. This book introduces AI use cases in business, education, and healthcare in detail. Moreover, we will also use the courses and developer resources offered on the PaddlePaddle AI Studio platform as well as video tutorials on PaddlePaddle’s Bilibili channel. Other resources that will be utilized include forums, blogs, articles, and publications on the internet. In addition, Baidu Apollo Intelligence Transport White Paper, Intelligent Revolution, and AI Transformation Playbook by AI scholar Andrew Ng are the companion reading materials of this course. Assignments: AI is an applied technology, which requires the combination of theories and practice to firmly grasp the fundamentals. Thus, this course has a set of companion learning activities to help students understand AI basics. These activities include reading, watching, analyses, and exercises. Students must complete these activities within a limited amount of time using the knowledge they acquired and available resources. Writing: There will be 10 writing assignments in this course. Students are tasked to compose articles on given topics, discussing a range of AI applications in industries. Reading: There will be reading assignments tasking students to integrate their own thoughts and compose short reports. This course includes 5 such reports. Programming: Students will participate in PaddlePaddle AI Studio courses and complete some programming exercises that review the basics of Python programming and train simple AI models with Paddle. All the articles and reports will be published on the Artificial Intelligence Blog on the personal website, and all the programming exercises will be published on Gitee. "

    "title": "Supporting a Made in China Future: Exploring Chinese artificial intelligence infrastructure",
    "body": "2022/04/06 - Google’s TensorFlow and Meta’s PyTorch are widely recognized and adopted deep learning frameworks. Both of which are coming from the United States. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a family of next-generation technology that will shape the world as we know it. With speech recognition, businesses can build virtual assistants to serve customers more effectively; with image recognition and autonomous systems, vehicles on the grounds, in the sky and under the sea are becoming intelligent; and with natural language processing, humans can communicate with machines more naturally, etc. All these advancements are brought by AI, and AI is transforming our ways of work and life. AI is more capable than ever before, and we can never say with certainty where its limit should be. Just like companies in the West, Chinese researchers and companies are also using U. S. -origin technology, software, and commodities to build AI models that will be deployed on their critical systems. As U. S. -China tensions further intensify, strained by a broad array of conflicts, it’s no longer safe to take access to these critical infrastructure for granted. The United States. through the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the Department of Commerce, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) at the Department of the Treasury, has sanctioned dozens Chinese universities, research institutions, and public as well as private sector companies for a variety of reasons from human rights abuses to military modernization efforts – all of which are targeting China’s most promising startups and industry giants. It is clear – it is clear that the United States sees China no more than a Strategic Competitor, a foreign adversary, and a national security threat. It is also clear that the United States intends to starve China’s businesses and research initiatives with an expansive list of restrictions from securities investment curbs to export control license requirements. It’s time to act, as I have repeatedly emphasized, to support Made in China with bold action. Thankfully, with the innovation, hard-work, and patriotism of the Chinese people, we’re not too strained by the United States’ edge in cutting-edge technology research. Megvii, a U. S. sanctioned Chinese AI startup, has developed and open sourced its in-house deep learning framework MegEngine. Megvii has advanced into an AI powerhouse with undeniable strengths in image recognition. Alipay and hundreds and thousands of other applications and devices are deploying Megvii’s AI solutions to enable financial transactions, secure critical infrastructure, and much more. Megvii has built MegEngine into an ecosystem with MegStudio that provides free GPU data processing capabilities, AI training courses, and a cloud-based environment for global developers to explore the magic of MegEngine. Similarly, Baidu, Inc. , the world’s largest Chinese-language search engine has been investing in AI research and development since 2010. It has released its home-made deep learning framework PaddlePaddle for individual and corporate developers to train AI models to meet a wide range of challenges from autonomous driving to counter-desertification efforts. Baidu’s AI Studio is also providing a platform for users to explore Baidu’s AI infrastructure, products, and services, putting AI technology into practice. Chinese universities, government, and the non-profit sector are also making contributions to the country’s mission of becoming self-reliant in technology. For instance, the Open AI Foundation, founded by a group of leading universities are providing resources for Chinese and global researchers, businesses, and governments to explore China’s AI offerings. The Ministry of Industry of Information Technology is also recognizing the breakthroughs at Chinese companies. DCloud, OSChina, CSDN, and countless others are also supporting the Chinese developer community by providing code hosting services, editing software, developer forums, funded competitions, open-source data sets, and other mediums for China to thrive in the AI era. Whilst we must keep an open mind when it comes to research and development in cutting-edge technology, we must put trust in ourselves and do our parts to support our great nation. Chinese universities, companies, and government have done their parts to build an AI future that’s Made in China. It’s time for us, the individuals and citizens of the People’s Republic of China, to support their efforts with action. As I navigate through career opportunities and my interest in AI, I will check out all these great products, services, commodities, technology, software and equipment from Chinese companies at home and abroad.

    "title": "Wondering Who’s Unfollowed You on Your Linkedin Network? Research Shows the Number of Followers Shown on Your LinkedIn Profile May Not Be Accurate",
    "body": "2022/04/06 - Yesterday, I turned on the Creator Mode on LinkedIn - a feature that adds a Follow button on your LinkedIn profile to allow other LinkedIn users to follow your content with or without sending a friend request. When you approve a connection request, LinkedIn automatically establishes a follower-ship between you and the person, unless this follower-ship is manually disabled by one side or both. I have 219 connections on LinkedIn, which means by default there should be 219 followers. When the Creator Mode is on, you can see the number of followers against the number of connections. It shows I have 210 followers but 219 connections, which means 9 connections unfollowed me since we friended on LinkedIn. LinkedIn won’t notify you when a connection unfollows or even disconnects from you. With this surprising finding, I searched all over the Web to see if there’s a solution to find out who these nine are. Whilst there are many people looking for such feature, and LinkedIn allows the export of certain data, there’s no readily available method to find out the people who unfollowed or unfriended on LinkedIn, so I decided to put my web scraping skill into practice. I’m proficient in Python programming and the BeautifulSoup web scraping library, which enables the extraction of data from HTML web pages. Since LinkedIn requires login, and I have yet to learn how to deal with websites that require sign-ins, so I decided to download web pages and save them in a local folder so that I can work with the files. I fired up Jupyter Notebook, imported BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and other required modules, and started working on this project. It didn’t take long for me to extract all the followers and connections from the downloaded pages from LinkedIn. Surprisingly, the number of followers based on my analysis was 218 instead of 210! That means the numbers shown on LinkedIn are incorrect, there was only one connection rather than nine that unfollowed me as a first degree connection. It didn’t take long for me to narrow down to that person. With the evidence at hand, I submitted a case to LinkedIn. I have yet to receive a response from the company, but I’m certain that there’s something not adding up here. Once confirmed, I will make an update on this website and publish my solution so that more people – both technical and non-technical – will be able to find out the people who secretly unfollowed them on LinkedIn or other social media platforms.

    "title": "Supporting Made in China with Action: Giving Home-Grown Entrepreneurs and Manufacturers a Pragmatic Assessment, an Inclusive Environment and a Fair Shot",
    "body": "2022/03/31 - In an article published a few days ago, I highlighted the importance for People’s Republic of China (China) citizens to exercise patriotism in supporting Made in China during this new era of great-power competition launched unilaterally by Washington D. C. Whether or not it is China’s intention to rival the United States of America (United States) in the first place, no one can or should deny that this rivalry is already in place. At least, it has been determined by Washington D. C. that a new era of great-power competition is underway. This commitment to support China with bold action starts right here. In the past several days, I’ve identified a list of Chinese alternatives to commonly used products and services imported from the United States and its Allies and partners. Once this list is complete, I will make it available on this website so that more people can see and understand the urgency of supporting Made in China in tangible steps and prompt them to act before it’s too late. This competition between the United States and the PRC has expanded into multiple disciplines over the last four years from trade, technology, to finance, etc. Today, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) identified a few more U. S. -listed Chinese companies that will face delisting risks under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFACC), which includes Baidu, Inc. , the largest Chinese-language search engine and a world-leading artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse, extending the list to include eleven Chinese companies. This yet again demonstrates the United States’ intention to pressure Chinese businesses and the urgent need for China’s resolve to confront and contain U. S. aggression. Chinese companies are much different from ten years ago. They’re more innovative, agile, and competitive. Megvii and Baidu are both leading AI companies not just within PRC borders but also widely recognized around the world. Both firms offer home-made deep learning frameworks, free and open-source. I have yet to check out MegEngine and PaddlePaddle, which can rival American alternatives such as TensorFlow from Google and PyTorch from Meta. Megvii and Baidu also provide freely accessible cloud-based building blocks for training AI models using these frameworks. It’s time to give these Made in China a fair shot. I’ve also moved from Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code to DCloud’s HBuilderX a few days ago. HBuilderX, as analysed in a previous blog post, is a free and open-source code editor from a Chinese company. I’ve been using it ever since. Whilst it still has a lot of work to do to catch up with Microsoft’s rivals, it is adequate for developers to build stunning applications. Similarly, I’ve moved from Figma to MasterGo for designing user interfaces and building the design system I announced in February, and I’ve moved from Microsoft Edge to 360 Secure Browser, etc. I’ve also recreated an account on Gitee, the largest code-hosting service in China, as an alternative to GitHub and Bitbucket. All these efforts are made to embrace a future that’s Made in China by helping Chinese businesses thrive and out-compete their foreign competitors. I’m embracing Made in China more than ever before. The PRC as a developing country has a lot more catch-up to do to out-compete the U. S. in this once-in-a-generation competition. Consumers here and abroad have been making buying decisions based solely upon price tags, features, and quality, etc. However, there is an enduring responsibility that’s embedded in citizenship: When the future of our country is at stake, we shall do all we can do to safeguard the homeland. If we lose China to the West, we have nowhere to escape. All businesses, both domestic and foreign, deserve a level-playing field, and all citizens shall uphold their patriotic duties when the bell rings. The American people are acting to protect the interests and rights of their motherland, so should PRC citizens. Embracing Made in China means giving greater tolerance for imperfection. In the past several decades, Reform and Opening has opened the Chinese market to import and export, spurred prodigious economic growth, and enriched the Chinese people’s lives. It is; however, way past the time to take pride of buying foreign goods over domestic ones. We shall step back to make our purchase decisions not only as consumers but also patriots. China has been relying heavily on the United States - the Western country that views China as a “Strategic Competitor”, an adversary, and inclines increasingly towards hostile policies against China - for everything from consumer goods to cutting-edge technology. We must put this to an end for the sake of our nation’s future and prosperity and never return to it because it’s more convenient to be the taker than the creator. If the Chinese society takes this competition more seriously, acknowledges the fact that the great-power rivalry is already here, and takes decisive action to protect the PRC’s vital interests by giving home-born entrepreneurs and manufacturers a more pragmatic view, an inclusive environment, and offer them a fair shot, we can save China’s - our great nation’s - future from America’s and other hostile nations’ mercy. It’s time for us to act as a people, as a nation, and as a civilization. "

    "title": "Recognizing the vital difference between career and job",
    "body": "2022/03/28 - Career and job. These two words are often used interchangeably when people talk about work. Career centres at universities seek to help students secure job offers. But, there is a small but vital difference between these two terms which is unmistakable and must be recognized. I never think these words should be interchangeable under any circumstance. This difference is critical in planning our professional life – careers to which we, as professionals, aspire. The first question comes to our mind when we graduate from college and start a career should be: What is a job? What does it mean to be unemployed or jobless? And, why is a job so important to us? To what extent it is an imperative? A belief – a strong belief – in a free and open Capitalist economy is that those who don’t work should not eat. Since early in our childhood, our parents, teachers, and mentors constantly remind us – or in a stronger sense, warn us – of the consequences should we not perform well academically. They say if we don’t do well in class, we won’t get jobs, we won’t be able to pay our bills, and we won’t be living the life we want. People are paying so much attention to employment but less so about building successful, life-changing careers. When parents and teachers talk about employment, they are mostly referring to job offers. A job is the work we do, either for ourselves or for employers, to get paid so that we can pay our bills, afford our house so that we don’t have to sleep on the streets. This is a broadly accepted definition of the word job which I concur. A job could be a cashier at McDonald’s front desk or a banker working at computer in Morgan Stanley’s building on the Wall Street. A job could be any role in society that sends us a paycheck for the work we do so that we can make a living. The society we live in mandates us having a job. This is true for most of us. Being unemployed means we don’t have the job that pays our bills. We risk living on the streets when we lose our jobs or fail to secure offers in job interviews. Jobs are so important to each and every one of us, but I personally believe that a career is even more important to us, which is a different concept from a job and the next topic that I want to discuss in detail. To put it simple, a career is different from a job in the sense that it goes far beyond making a living. It weighs much heavier than a paycheck. People don’t build careers just to make a couple thousand bucks but to enrich their lives, broaden their horizons, and elevate their professional standings. Let me give you an example of a career. Andrew Ng is an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University for Computer Science. He’s also the founder of Coursera, which is the largest MOOC platform in the world. He also serves as the CEO of three artificial intelligence (AI) companies that he founded - Deep Learning AI, Landing AI, and AI Fund. AI to Andrew is more than a job – he has built it into his career – a career that he’s passionate about. A career that enriches his life and elevates his standing. Countless people watch Andrew’s machine learning courses on Coursera, on YouTube, and through other mediums. People see him as an authority in the field of AI. This is a epitome of what I call a successful career. You can derive the definition of career from the example above. A career is a professional field of focus about which we are passionate. It goes beyond paying our bills to enrich our lives and lift our standing. When we say a career, we are talking about a field to which we aspire. A field that we are eager to set foot in and make a living of. I believe we all should look to build careers rather than securing jobs when it comes to professional development. Careers must be looked in a long-term view. It transcends short-term contracts and extend throughout our lifetime. Building a strong career will help us unleash our true potential, realize our value, make high return on investments and enrich our lives, both professionally and personally. This is the pivotal role of the difference between a career and a job that should play in our professional decisions. "

    "body": "2022/03/26 - As the United States continues to impose arbitrary sanctions on Chinese companies and the technology race between the two largest economies continues to intensify, we can no longer ignore the lasting consequence of not building a strong economy and foundation for future development on Made in China. One of the responsibilities that comes with citizenship is supporting our country when the future of which is at risk. This is that moment, and more people should recognize this pacing challenge. To support Made in China, we must take bold action. Yesterday, I exempted certain Chinese service providers from the Internet Security Entity List - a tool I developed last year to identify and block access to software applications and internet-based services that maliciously acquire sensitive user data without proper transparency and/or authorization. This allows me to register accounts with these services. The United States of America has been a leader in technology. It has dominated many fields of technology from industrial software, electronic devices, to the design and fabrication of cutting-edge semiconductors. In the past four years under Trump and now under Biden, the United States has shown its intention to use export controls, investment restrictions, and other forms of sanctions to pressure Chinese national champions. In the words of Gina M. Raimondo, the U. S. Secretary of Commerce, the United States intends to “slow down” China’s innovation. Supporting a Chinese-made future is more important than ever. As citizens of the People’s Republic of China, we should on longer make our buying decision based solely on quality and features. We should as well take into account how our decision can contribute to China, Inc. and the future of our civilization. We shall take a long-term view, transcend short-term buying cycles, and take up the enduring patriotic responsibility to ensure that our nation wins the 21st Century and beyond, and it can prosper without fearing the threats from rogue states on the world stage. A critical step in supporting Chinese goods and services is to identify Chinese alternatives to imports from the United States. We can no longer bear the catastrophic consequence of allowing U. S. companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google and Autodesk to dominate our operating systems, smart phones, app stores, and industrial software, etc. We must support Huawei’s HarmonyOS, Xiaomi’s smart phone, Kingsoft’s WPS Office, Baidu’s PaddlePaddle deep learning framework and hundreds and thousands of other Chinese made-and-owned products, services, and technologies that deserve to be known, used, and celeberated that will shape our shared future. We should also acknowledge that the PRC as a developing country is still far behind the USA in a number of areas from technology, defence, to geopolitical influence. Supporting Made in China means greater tolerance for imperfection, willingness to take the longer route, desire to contribute to Chinese communities, and exercising patriotic duties and responsibilities that come with citizenship. Our nation can only outcompete the U. S. and other aggressors should we act in unison. Before the end of day, I will update my Internet Security Entity List rules and publish a list to identify Chinese alternatives to foreign imports on my website. I believe more people should understand the magnitude and gravity of the great-power competition in this new era. All the patriots should act now to secure China’s prosperous future. "

    "body": "2022/03/20 - 這是一篇發佈在中文網誌上的文章。 第 45 任美國總統當勞‧J‧川普上任以來，美中關係持續下滑。從川普政府早期的對華貿易戰，到中期對華為、中芯國際等中國在通訊、半導體等產業的高科技企業的打壓，再到 2019 冠狀病毒的全球擴散，籠罩在華府和北京之前的烏雲不斷加厚、加深。美中兩國間的矛盾已由初期的經貿延伸至科技、政治和軍事等多個領域。 儘管現任拜登政府的對華政策相較於川普時期沒有那麼激進，多位官員繼承了川普政府的對華政策。上任首年，美國現任商務部長吉娜‧M‧蕾蒙多就將多家中國超算和量算機構列入出口限制實體清單。美國財政部也於舊年末對多家中國領先的人工智能企業實施投資限制。雖然拜登政府主張「競爭與合作」併進的對華政策，在技術方面美國顯然延續了川普政府的「脫鈎」政策。 相較於對個別幹部實施的個人制裁，或許美國商務部旗下產業與安全局的出口管治和美國財政部旗下外國資產控制辦公室的金融制裁更讓中國頭疼。無論出於維護人權、國家安全或外交利益，這兩個美國政府機構的決定都會直接影響中國獲取尖端技術以發展自身的能力。以最近的事件為例，美國乃至全球常用的用戶體驗設計軟件 Figma 宣佈以遵守美國政府制裁為由，封禁大疆創新等多家中國被限制企業、機構和院校的帳號，禁止彼等使用美國產出的技術。 相較於其它國家，美國較早發展技術並在多個領域佔據了相對優勢。Adobe 的 Photoshop 跟 Illustrator，Autodesk 旗下的 AutoCAD 和 3D Max，Microsoft 旗下的 Windows 跟 Office，還有 MathWork 旗下的 MatLab 和 Simulink 等軟件佔有全球主要市場份額。失去使用這些軟件的權限意味着在與對手競爭中可能失去一些優勢。美國企圖透過多重手段讓中國企業減少研發開支和佔據全球領導地位的野心。 鑑於共和黨與民主黨一致將中國定性為美國的「戰略競爭對手」，美國對華打壓舉措或會延續並愈演愈烈，不斷升級。面對地緣政治壓力，中國別無選擇，必須發展起自己的核心技術，包括基礎軟件。 一次偶然，我發現了一款來自中國團隊的代碼編輯器 —— HBuilderX。代碼編輯器就屬於基礎軟件。程式員透過編寫軟件解決各類難題。長期以來，美國的 Visual Studio Code、Atom 以及澳大利亞的 Sublime Text 等軟件佔據這一市場的主導地位。這些軟件開源開放，由發展多年的技術公司提供支持，擁有強大而有活力的開發者社區，從學校到企業都使用這些軟件，中國機構也不例外。經過一輪研究，雖然 BuilderX 使用了 Eclipse 跟 Visual Studio Code 的開源代碼，作為少數由中國團隊開發、免費提供給開發者的基礎軟件，我還是希望給予其機會以評估與主流國外軟件的差距。 與國外軟件不同，這款編輯器採用壓縮代碼包的形式發佈，無需透過繁雜的安裝流程，直接從官方網站上下載解壓即可使用。打開 hbuilderx. exe 的可執行文件便可啟動軟件。這一設計比較像 OpenRefine，開包即用，非常方便。初次啟用，會有一個對話框，用來選擇主題。總體而言，HBuilderX 的設計非常簡單，目前有三種主題，這些主題或均來源自 Visual Studio Code 的開源設區（查看 plugins 文件夾就可以斷定）。打開後，您就可以看到如下界面： 個人覺得，這樣的設計非常簡約、大氣。作為開發工具，一個清爽的界面是非常有必要的。為了體驗 HBuilderX 的功能，我決定用這個網誌作為測試，嘗試開發網頁。 和 Visual Studio Code 及其它很多代碼編輯器一樣，在 HBuilderX 裏面可以直接打開項目的目錄。這樣一來，開發者就無需不斷開啟和關閉文件。我認為這一功能是區分一般文本編輯器和代碼編輯器的重要不同之處，也是一個基本功能。很欣慰的是，HBuilderX 俱備這一功能。下圖左側的文件目錄就是項目文件目錄。 接下來，打開 index. html，看看語法高光效果如何。語法檢測同樣是區別代碼編輯器和一般編輯器的一個重要不同。它幫助開發者們更輕鬆地找到程式中可能存在的問題。從下面兩張軟件截圖中我們可以看到，HBuilderX 內置了多個語言。而且，無論是 HTML、CSS 或是 JavaScript，甚至於 Python，HBuilderX 的語法標註系統都還是很不錯的。內置的語法高光系統可以在多種類型的文件中運行，包括 HTML 和 markdown 文件等。  HBuilderX 同樣擁有插件功能。這些插件可由自由開發者設計、開發和發行。同時，HBuilderX 兼容了不少來自成熟軟件的插件，比如 Eclipse 和 Visual Studio Code 的插件生態。用戶可以直接從 GitHub 等資源庫下載和安裝 HBuilderX。 儘管 HBuilderX 支持外部插件，在這一方面與成熟的開發者軟件還是有相當距離的。比如，在 Visual Studio Code 中，用戶可以不離開軟件，無需登錄帳號即可搜尋並下載各式插件。很多插件，安裝方可使用，無需人工配置，更不需要編寫代碼。很多插件也有詳盡的使用說明。開發者也極積回應用戶反饋。這些是 HBuilderX 的生態暫不俱備的。 開發慾按裝插件就必須離開 HBuilderX 軟件，打開網頁瀏覽器並訪問官方插件市場，挑選合適的插件並登錄帳號按裝。下載後，很多插件需要人工配置才能正常使用。問題是，不少插件缺乏詳細說，開源者也沒有極積回應用戶的疑難之處。因此，在插件這塊的體驗，我認為還是遠不如國外軟件的。另外，我想說明一點，目前 HBuilderX 不支持註銷帳號。作為一個對私穩極度著重的人來講，我是強烈不建議在任何不提供便捷消號功能的平台上創建帳戶和提交個人資料的。 在這篇文章的最後，我還想聊聊 HBuilderX 的配套服務。HBuilderX 擁有一個官方文檔和幫助社區。同戶可透過這些文件瞭解 HBuilderX 的使用。目前來說，擁有這些設施的國產軟件並不多。同樣的，這些領域，HBuilderX 還有不少上升空間，但是總體而言，我認為還是不錯的。  國產軟件技術和生態必須發展起來。這是應對美國等對中國發展心存不良圖謀國家最有力的回擊。國產軟件還有很大的提昇空間，目前用起來，質素和體驗均未達到國際水準。但是，要想把軟件做起來，這需要用戶的使用也需要開發者的投入。我們需要多包容並盡量使用國產，向開發者提供建設性意見而開發商也需極積回饋。衹有這樣，中國基礎設施類軟件，纔有可能在國內和海外市場殺出一片屬於自己的天！ "

    "body": "2022/03/20 - In a previous postI complained about YouTube depriving me and many other users of access to its video sharing and streaming service simply because we deleted our unused account. At the time of this writing, I’m still stuck in thisuncomfortable situation like many others. My access to YouTube. com hasn’t been stored, and I still can’t find a way to contact YouTube’s representatives to have this issue addressed. Engineering is supposed to makethings easy. Deleting data shouldn’t take this long. In this blog post, I’d like to share from my point ofvideo how YouTube can improve its customer service so that both the business and its customers like you andme can better off in situations like this. YouTube has grown rapidly into a global video sharing service with thousands and millions of users consuminginformation from YouTube on a daily basis worldwide. YouTube was acquired by Google in the last decade and had since expanding across multiple disciplines and markets. Just like other Google services, YouTube has an official help centre where users come to find solutions to their concerns with YouTube’s products. To manage such a huge customer base, YouTube’s help centre incorporates modern technologies to make it as smartas possible. Hiring hundreds of people responding to similar questions related to YouTube isn’t cost effective. From my experience, the help centre is designed to be autonomous, meaning that it requires as less time fromYouTube’s staff as possible. The help centre has a search bar. When users type in their questions, the search tool will generate a list of threads from help forums posted by other users, prompting users to search for answers from existing threads. Whilst this setup can free up a lot of time from YouTube’s employees, it’s troublesome in some rare cases like mine. Since removing my channel with no original uploads, likes, or comments, with just six playlists built from videos uploaded by other users and a hundred subscriptions, I’ve been locked out from YouTube account. WheneverI try to sign in to YouTube with my Google account, it always displays an error page with a message saying thatI can’t sign in while my data is being deleted. I understand that data deletion can take some time as I’m a web developer myself. However, after one hour, three days, now an entire week, I start to get more irritating as I continue tobe blocked out from the largest video community in the world for doing nothing in violation of YouTube’s policiesor anything wrong or unethical. This puts me - and users who’re in similar situations - in a very uncomfortableplace. I search all over the Web for solutions to fix this problem. I see many threads online complaining about the sameissue. The oldest post was made in 2015. There’re more recent posts as well. There’re countless complaints on thisbug on Quora, Reddit, and YouTube’s very own help forum. None of these included a solution - either from users who suffered from this nonsense or from representatives at YouTube. So I visited YouTube’s help centre in hope toget in touch with some customer support specialists. The help centre, whether you start with the search bar on the front page or click through contact options, you’re always prompted to enter your question in a wizard, and that wizard will always pop up some close threads related tothe issue. All of them are authored by users, and none of them offered a solution. There isn’t a way to hold a live cchat with a customer service representitive or write an email to YouTube to report the issue. I’m not even a professionalYouTuber. Just imagine how frustrated would be for YouTubers and businesses that rely on the site for a living when they’re put through this chaos. I believe there’re many ways for YouTube to improve its customer support solution so that everyone – both the companyand its customers – will better off. I think YouTube’s current strategy is working. An automated help centre is a fit fororganisations of YouTube’s size. However, there’re many details that YouTube can refashion and refine. First, YouTube should do more work to make its help centre effective. Rather than pointing users to a list of threads,YouTube should develop mechanisms to rate the quality of the threads and solutions offered in these threads. Threads withoutaccepted solutions should remain open to new input whether or not they’re active. I see a dozen thread on YouTube complainingabout exactly the same problem. This shouldn’t have happened. It’s frustrating to click and read through all the posts. This is time-consuming and ineffective. YouTube should aggregate the threads, use algorithms or manual labour to combinethreads on same topics. Stack Overflow – the professional developer community – has been doing a fabulous job at this. When users visit the centre, they expect to get their answers as quickly and effortlessly as possible. Who doesn’t want tosave their precious time? By combining threads, users can find relevant content much easier. Second, replies to thread questions that offer no value should be removed after some time. It makes no sense to repeat what others have said. I’ve seen in many of the threads many users are simply replicating thecomplaints.    “Yes, I encountered the same issue. Please help!”     “I don’t know what’s happening, I’ve been looking all over the place and still find no clue…”  Posts like these add little to no value to the help forum threads. These should be removed either periodically or after a solutionhas been identified and accepted. Online customer service is much more than providing a place for customers to vant. It shouldput customers at the centre and help them achieve their objectives. It shouldn’t stop untile customer demands are fulfilled. Third, there should be a human service option somewhere. YouTube simply can’t and shouldn’t rely upon automation to serveits customers. Whilst the wizards are in one way or another effective in addressing users’ concerns, not all issues can be addressedin the user community without engagement with corporate representatives. Afterall, YouTube is the provider who created the service,no one knows better about YouTube than YouTube. Some months ago, I had a problem with my Autodesk account. Autodesk is another prominent software provider with offerings that include some of the most widely used industrial design software solutions such as Fusion and AutoCad. The customer service from Autodesk was far more superior than that of YouTube. Whilst I wasn’t able to log into my account, I was able to hold a livechat with company representatives who very patiently analyse my issue, walked me through some solutions, provided me an email address to follow up on the problem, and, after everything failed, the representative handed me over to another specialist to assist me until I successfully fixed the problem. This is what quality customer service should look like. It’s approachable, charming, andeffective. In the case of YouTube, I don’t feel like I’m being treated fairly. There really isn’t a customer service. My recommendation would be for YouTube to rate the threads and solutions using either an algorithmatic solution orhuman service specialist. If a thread contains a working solution, then the wizard should prompt the user to view that thread first. If the user concludes that the thread isn’t helping, there should be a place for the user to provide feedback by rating the thread and solution. Then, YouTube should encourage the user to offer more details by creating a new thread and inviting some real human representatives from YouTube to participate in the thread or hold a live chart or have some back and forth email communications to help address issues. YouTube may also collect customer feedback on their service to understand customers demands and expectations better. Help forums shoud include not only inputs from users but also inputs from YouTube. I believe by making these changes, both YouTube and its customers can be better off. YouTube can maintain a good reputation and higher quality service while customers can have their concerns effective addressed. These are all I have come up with as of now. I will update this article to include more solutions for YouTube to make its customer service better. "

    "title": "Building multiple paginated blogs with Jekyll Paginate V2 (jekyll-paginate-v2) on the same static website",
    "body": "2022/03/09 - I’ve been thinking about how I can make this website more useful for visitors since the launch of the site at the beginning of this year. I want to present my knowledge, demonstrate what I am capable of by building this site from scratch and featuring some projects that I completed before, and those that I’m currently working on. This website also has a blog section where I post my thoughts on a broad range of topics from web development, data science, to artificial intelligence. I hope to share my thoughts and learning experience so that others can benefit from these sharings. As a static website, it becomes more and more challenging to maintain as the number of pages grows. This site is hosted freely at Bitbucket. io, a similar code hosting service to GitHub. When the site was launched, I only had one blog. All the posts that I publish are shown in the same section. Whilst I incorporated post tags and a static search tool to help visitors navigate through the content, it’s still hard to find information because I have 10 pages of posts on different topics. I thought having several blogs each concentrates on a single topic would make it easy for readers to find content. However, this is quite difficult considering the limited functionality of static websites. To make it easy for me to edit the content on the website, I used Jekyll to build this site. Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby, created by GitHub. It can generate HTML pages from markdown files based on pre-designed custom templates to create static websites. It has a robust open-source community comprising of developers from around the globe. Developers collaborate on and release value-added features to help Jekyllers (people who build with Jekyll) to achieve more with the tool. Whilst I’ve never learned – not even heard of – Ruby prior to meeting Jekyll, I’ve been able to get the hing of it painlessly. I’ve been doing extensive research on Jekyll as I continue to scale the website. I came across a great pagination tool (Ruby gem) called jekyll-paginate-v2. Many Jekyll related gems have Jekyll in their names. jekyll-paginate-v2 is an upgraded version of jekyll-paginate. When I built the first blog, I used jekyll-paginate, which only works in index. html files and supports just one page. Because of that, I wasn’t able to realize my design ambition of having multiple concentrated blogs on the same website. Unlike jekyll-paginate, jekyll-paginate-v2 is capable of much more: it supports not only index files but other files as well. It allows multiple blogs on the same website – exactly the same feature that I’ve been craving for. And, it allows developers to filter blog posts by tags and categories. Since I tagged all my posts, so it is fairly easy for me to build multiple concentrated blogs by filtering tags. This is how I have four blogs on this website! Check out my main blog where I post random stuff and everything from the concentrated blogs at https://mrlizhaozhi. bitbucket. io/blogs/, my web development blog at https://mrlizhaozhi. bitbucket. io/blogs/web-development/, my data science blog at https://mrlizhaozhi. bitbucket. io/blogs/data-science/ and my artificial intelligence blog at https://mrlizhaozhi. bitbucket. io/blogs/artificial-intelligence. I will talk more about each of these blogs in other posts. "

    "body": "2022/03/03 - In the next two days, I will achieve a big milestone - finishing the eleven chapters in Part I of Python Crash Course on programming basics – Hooray! But before I celebrate this accomplishment, I want to step back and reflect critically on my learning path. Knowledge and skills are different. They’re intertwined and equally important. This is why I’ve been separating the two to emphasise that I must acquire both to truly grasp the fundamentals of web development, data science and artificial intelligence. So far, I’ve been investing heavily in acquiring skills but not so much in acquiring knowledge. I’ve been learning Python, R, Power BI and other tools essential to data science. It’s true that these are critical to success in a data-centric career; however, they’re not everything that matter. To succeed in a data career, I must also grasp the fundamentals of statistics and mathematics as well as computer science. This set of knowledge will form the basis for further advancement. Without the support of knowledge, skills can hardly be applied in the most effective way. Hence, I must return to the basics and invest more time and resources in acquiring the knowledge underpinning the web, analytics and AI. To help facilitate this transition from laser focus on skills to equivalent emphasis on both knowledge and skills, I will roll out an action plan. This plan will ensure that I make reasonable progress on acquisition of both knowledge and skills so that I have the understanding of theories needed to apply my skills in the right way and support my research activities.

    "body": "2022/02/23 - Pursuant to the strategy of building a design system for web-based application development, I’m rolling out an action plan to develop a design system for replicating consistent, recognisable and accessible web-based digital experiences. This design system will be used in future applications and made available to global developers. A design system has some essential components: 1) commonly used components in web applications, 2) sample code for implementing these components, 3) guidelines defining the best practices in application development and 4) detailed documentation instructing users on how to use the tools that the system provides. The system I’m about to build will include all these essentials. I’m aiming to build a system that is maintainable, scalable and easy to use for both experienced and entry-level developers. A successful design system is useful in a collaborative development environment. Developers can work together on the same system to build applications that are accessible. This is exactly what I’m trying to achieve. It requires well-documented code and documentation. Unlike traditional design systems like Bootstrap and the U. S. Web Design System that focus on front-end design, the design system I’m about to develop will encompass both the front and back ends of web applications. It will include front-end components such as navigation bar, footer, and carousel as well as server-side programs such as search, forms, and transaction handlers. The design system will be comprehensive and useful for building both front-and back-end features. The design system will have its own set of rules, designs and features. I will write my own code to build this system, and the system won’t use code from existing systems. It’s imperative that the system is original and unique. Whilst I may consult video tutorials and literature to learn the basics, I must build each component for the system from scratch instead of using others’ code. To aid the development of this design system, I will be building and using a set of tools. I will use a checklist to plan the features to be included in the system to ensure that no necessary feature is missed, and no unnecessary feature is included. I will document the features as I build. This is the best approach to ensure that the documentation will be accurate and understandable. I will create a calendar to make sure that I finish developing and testing the system before the launch date. These tools will work collectively to help me deliver a design system that can replicate accessible experiences on the Web. "

    "title": "Better approach to learning web development: Sticking with one project",
    "body": "2022/02/20 - The Web is a constantly evolving field. Continuous learning is critical to staying relevant. I’ve been building the Web for two years now. I’ve tried two approaches to acquiring web development knowledge and skills. Whilst these approaches are similar, the outcomes are different.  Old Approach: My passion for the Web primarily stemmed from its visual design. Before attending university to study finance and information systems, I considered becoming an artist – I wanted to be an animator, an art director but not a banker or technologist. The Web brought me back to the path towards art and design. I spent a fair amount of time designing web pages with HTML and CSS. This impulsive pursuit of aestheticism led me to create lots of websites. My learning model was basically producing as many websites as I could. Web development; however, is much more than visual design. Typical web apps have a front and a back end. They run on database systems to collect user inputs and capture the data needed for business analysts to retrieve insights and improve products and services. Dynamic web applications will continue to dominate the Web market yet virtually all the websites that I’ve built so far are static – they don’t have many practical features. They don’t have server-side programs for collecting and processing data. They’re simply web-based slide decks presenting static information. This is not enough to make me an adequate web developer. New Approach: After graduation, I joined a multinational organisation working as a business analyst. This full-time job is a challenge. I need to spend days and nights analysing large data sets to retrieve actionable business insights; therefore, spending hours crafting designs is no longer viable. Thus, I moved away from the original learning model to stick around with one of the websites that I built in school and focus on improving that single website. Problems with the Old Approach: The old approach was mainly driven by my impulse to create new designs. This learning model enabled me to think creatively, but it has several problems. NO1. Lack of practice: Moving from design to design did not give me enough opportunities to practise coding. When I move from one design to another, a large chunk of code is directly borrowed from the old website. I was able to create new ones with the same set of code and a little modification. Most of the time; therefore, was spent on moving files rather than doing research on new features. Whilst the websites are visually different, they’re identical technologically. My obsessive focus on design is just one of the reasons behind my constant switch between projects. Another reason is that I tend to take the path of least resistance – I’d stick with what I’m familiar with rather than trying new stuff. When the design is complete, it’s time to improve the website to add more features. This requires more logical thinking and less aesthetic consideration , which isn’t something that I’m good at. When the maths outweighs design, I become less confident in my skills and start to persuade myself to move on to the next project. Even visual design requires some logic – HTML and CSS are just markup languages. JavaScript is also used in building front-end designs, yet I’ve rarely used it because writing HTML and CSS is a lot easier than writing JavaScript programs. NO2. Lack of challenge: The lack of practice leads to an even more significant problem – the absence of challenges. When we encounter challenges, we will push ourselves to find solutions, think out of the box, and attempt new approaches that we have not tried before. This is how we learn and grow. And, when there’s no challenge, we’re simply replicating what we are already familiar with. This won’t help us grow because we’re staying inside our comfort zone. We will never get to explore new opportunities and challenge ourselves to do more and better. If I never dive deeper, I can only do such much on the Web. I will never know how to write JavaScript to improve the design, use PHP programs to collect and process data and use SQL to administer relational databases. I’m missing many opportunities to grow by repeating what I’ve been doing with HTML and CSS. NO3. Time consuming: The most serious flaw in this strategy, however, is the loss of valuable time. I prepared for my first commercial project over the course of three months of research and practice. As a full-time employee, I now only have a few evenings and weekends to explore the Web. This strategy is becoming increasingly unviable. I no longer have enough time to do things like move files around — things that don’t help me grow and achieve more. Learning new things and putting in additional practice time is a much better use of time. Advantages of the New Approach: Let’s get into why I switched to a new learning approach. I had no choice but to shift away from the old approach because of its three flaws. The benefits of the new technique make it a good choice for this move. NO1. More challenges (aka growth): One of the problems of the old strategy was the lack of challenge, but it is an advantage of the new approach. Rather of switching between websites, sticking to one allows me to think more imaginatively about what I might do better given certain limits. Without the option of starting over, I must examine viability as well as what I may improve upon without significantly altering what I’ve built. This method pushes me to step outside of my comfort zone and attempt new things. If there’s nothing further I can do using HTML and CSS, I’ll have to resort to JavaScript and other Web-critical technologies for which I lack the necessary understanding and competence. Using this method, I’ve challenged myself to better deal with browser compatibility by researching layout ideas, used Jekyll to generate static HTML pages from markdown files – something I never thought was feasible, and even built in a static search engine using Lunr. Js and JSON! NO2. More thoughtful: Sticking with one website has also made me a thoughtful individual. It forces me to reflect critically on the product and look for ways to improve it. I can take my skills to the next level by continuously improving my work only if I can see what I’ve not done good enough. Web development isn’t just writing code. 10,000 lines of code without much thinking won’t be as rewarding as one line of thoughtful code. There’re many developers who are fluent in Web technologies, but not many of them are thoughtful – they view themselves as coders rather than owners. I found this new approach to have shaped me into a product manager who’s capable of coding rather than just another developer who knows only how to code a website. NO3. More efficient: Better yet, this new approach is significantly more efficient than the old approach because I don’t need to spend time moving files. Every line of code I write challenges me to attempt new things. This helps me improve my skills. Spending the same amount of time, I can learn a lot more by adopting the new approach than using the old approach. I’ve made the previous versions of this website accessible to the public at archives. You can see the evoluation of this website. By comparing the latest version of this website, aka the current website, with the older versions, you can see the progress I’ve made. Knowing that the new approach is more efficient, I will continue to focus on improving the current website. You will see more improvements made to the current website in the coming weeks. By sticking with one design, I can focus my resources on navigating untouched waters and push me out of my comfort zone to challenge the status quo and make better web-based experiences. "

    "body": "2022/02/10 - I’m working on a design system for web-based application development. This system will provide a set of guidelines, tools and code for replicating consistent, recognisable, scalable and accessible digital experiences. A design system is basically a decomposed website. It consists of commonly used components and widgets, code for implementing these components and widgets, guidelines defining the best practice in application development and documentation instructing users on how to use the design system. Design systems are handy in collaborative development environments; therefore, they should be usable by not only one but multiple developers. Since web-based and mobile applications are different in a number of ways, this design system will focus on the Web. It will incorporate responsive and mobile-first design as well as other design principles and industrial standards to deliver quality digital services. Many businesses, organisations and governments have their own design systems. The United States government, for example, uses the U. S. Web Design System (USWDS) - a design system developed within the government - to build government agency websites and public service platforms. HSBC, the 200-year-old British multinational financial services organisation, has its own design system for building banking systems. I’m building my own design system for several reasons. As a web professional, I build lots of websites and web-based applications. In the past, when I start a new project, I needed to implement everything from scratch. This involves conducting research on techniques that I forgot and testing each component that I build. This fashion of web development is ineffecient. With a design system, I can reuse my previous designs and programs in new projects and focus more on building project-specific features. It will help me drastically improve work quality and productivity. Building a design system will be a rewarding experience. I can learn to build each component and sharpen my development skills along the way. It will provide a framework for acquiring web development knowledge and skills structurally, which would be beneficial in the long term. I will continue to provide updates and launch a website dedicated to this design system. On this site, you will find more information about the design system, including a more detailed introduction, web components, usable code blocks, guidelines on web design and documentation of the system.

    "body": "2022/02/06 - LinkedIn is a professional social networking service operated by Microsoft Corporation. The service enables global engagement between professionals across academia, business, non-profit and public sectors. The service was one of the few remaining American social networks in Mainland China. In December 2021, Microsoft announced the sunset of LinkedIn’s China edition and introduced a new app called InCareer. Unlike LinkedIn which prioritises the social elements in careers, InCareer is a job board application on which companies can publish job openings and job seekers can apply to the jobs. The application doesn’t have social media support like LinkedIn. LinkedIn users can follow companies and connect with professionals from around the world, catch up with the latest updates from the companies and people in their networks and communicate with each other in chatrooms. All of these features that set LinkedIn apart from its competitors are gone with the launch of InCareer in Mainland China. Whilst studying in the United States, I had a class in which the professor spent half of the lecture instructing students to set up their LinkedIn profiles, connect with other students and professionals and search and apply for jobs. LinkedIn is indeed a great tool for professional social networking. Prominent companies post updates and jobs on the platform and the feeds are tailored to fit users’ preferences. It has been the only bridge connecting me with a few of my friends in the United States and China because it was the only accessible foreign social media in China. After the removal of LinkedIn, InCareer became the only download option in Chinese app stores. All the networking features are gone, including news updates and overseas job opportunities from companies. It has also become much harder to find and follow companies and connect with people. Without the social elements that LinkedIn prioritised, the update to InCareer has significantly diminished the service’s value. Even with the once available social media support, the intrinsic value of LinkedIn is still in question. Whilst I connected with some 220 professionals, most of them were connected during or after networking events. I never got to engage with them and get to know them personally. Most connections just sit there, adding no value to career research and job application. Companies not only post updates and host career talks on LinkedIn but also on other social media platforms such as WeChat, Twitter, Bilibili and YouTube. Now, with even less useful features, I believe it’s time to reevaluate the service’s value and its future. This isn’t my first time creating a LinkedIn account. With my long-term career residing in China and better domestic alternatives available, I’m finding other ways to remain connected with my friends instead of using LinkedIn or its InCareer application. I may delete my account and remove all data from the platform and will not return to this service before June 2022. "

    "body": "2022/02/02 - On 1st February 2022, the United States Department of Homeland Security launched a new official site - DHS. gov. Prior to the official launch, the new site was made accessible at https://preview. dhs. gov/ for preview. I was one of the site’s first visitors who left feedback on the website. In this post, I will review the website from a professional web developer’s standpoint. Click here for the official announcement. Using the Wayback Machine, you can see the evolution of DHS. gov. By comparing the design of the current website and the last version, we can see the overall appearance has undergone a significant improvement. The new theme looks a lot cleaner than the previous version, which is a good thing.  Just like the previous version of DHS. gov, the new website is a multiple-page website instead of a single-page website. MPAs are known for their advantages in search engine optimisation (SEO). They’re well suited for government uses. Unlike the old DHS. gov, the new website lists policy issues using cards instead of a carousel, making it easier to find and access different pages. Carousels were a fashion in the early age of web development. Many major websites adopted carousels to display as much information as possible on the front page and other pages, but this is no longer the case. Web designers now prefer a static hero image over a changing one.  Whilst the design has been improved significantly, there’re a few accessibility and compatibility flaws on the newly launched website. These flaws have undermined the overall user experience on the website. One of the accessibility flaws is identified on biographies pages. Take a look at the following example: When the page is displayed on a mobile device, the text will be squeezed into the upper left corner next to the profile image, making it difficult to read the text.  A better way to display the text and image is to make the image full screen on mobile devices and all texts shown below the image. Another accessibility flaw belongs to the mobile nagivation bar. As can be seen from the following screenshot, the new site uses a side bar with accordions to display navigation menu. On a small screen, it’s pretty hard to read texts smashed into the right side. A better way to do this, I think, is to make the nagivation menu full screen.  Finally, a significant compatibility issue is identified in Internet Explorer 11. In general, the United States government follows the 2% rule, meaning that all browsers with more than 2% traffic should be condsidered when building accessible public digital services. The Department’s previous website was compatible with IE so should the new website. Whilst Microsoft announced the official retirement of IE in 2021, the browser is still used at homes and in offices across the globe. The browser has not yet gone into history. As shown in the following screenshots, the updated DHS. gov is completely not compatible with IE and perhaps other Tident-based web browsers as well.  These are the design problems I observed from the new DHS. gov so far. As the Department continues its web modernisation efforts, there surely will be more updates made to the site. I will continue to visit the site and discuss user experience issues in blog posts. I will expand this product review article series to include other products and services as well, including but not limited to web-based and mobile application, electronic devices and others. "

I spent the last four years attending school in the United States, so I wasn’t able to return home and celebrate with my family and friends in China. I look forward to this family reunion trip. Looking back at 2021, I achieved quite a few accomplishments. Whilst COVID-19 variants continued to storm across the globe, 2021 is a key milestone. I graduated from Marquette University in May 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Finance and Information Systems, marking the end of university life and the official beginning of adulthood. I returned to China subsequently in June. I’ve not been able to fly home since the virus spreaded across the world and severely impacted air travel and movements. In July, I received the offer call from HSBC, and I joined this organisation in late July as Global Operations Graduate Trainee. This is my first full-time job. Last Friday, I wrapped up my first rotation at the international bank. Over the course of the past six months, I was put in charge of four process enhancement and automation projects. I got opportunities to build an Excel VBA-powered tool to help new colleagues grasp the basics of our business and used Alteryx Designer to build automation solutions that helped speeding up tedious, repetitive tasks across the bank’s Hang Seng business, which enhanced customer experience through shortening wait time. 2021 wasn’t a year without challenges. I failed numerous job assessments and interviews and got my Alteryx Certificate revoked. These challenges present opportunities for growth. I learned a lot about project management in professional setting. I learned to manage stakeholder relationships, communicate ideas, and collaborate with colleagues more effectively. 2022 is another big year for me. I will transition into a business analyst role, a job that I aspire to. I have a lot more learnings to do to seize opportunities. I’m confident that the Web Master and Data Analytics and Intelligence Programmes will help me prepare for a bright career future. I look forward to a fruitful year to come in 2022! "

However, not every feature the service offers is good to have. One such example is the downvote button. When your solution gets upvoted, you earn reputation points. When you’re downvoted on any solution; however, you lose reputation points on your entire profile. This penalty discourages the exchange of ideas and the spirit of helping. By removing the downvote feature, Stack Overflow can become an even more inclusive and vibrant community for global developers to share and exchange. "

    "body": "2022/01/23 -  I’ve been learning web development for two years since I took my very first web development course in junior year at college. Reflecting on this enjoyable and fruitable adventure, I’ve truly learned a lot and fallen in love with the Web. In the web development course, I followed one of my favourite professors Dr. Terence T. Ow to learn the basics of web development. That was the first time I meet HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP - the four languages widely used in web development. We learned to build static as well as dynamic web apps. Most of our efforts were concentrated on building functionalities such as login and logout, search tool and pagination, etc. We didn’t spend much time designing accessible webpages. Following the semester, I took part in a web project during the summer of 2020. That was the first time I’m in charge of a full-scale commercial web development project. As the tech lead and project manager, I designed, developed and planned the entire project. I integrated almost everything I learned from the web development class and took extra miles to learn functionalities that were not covered in class such as sending out system emails and managing email subscriptions. I also met Bootstrap on that project. That was the first time I learned about the concept of responsive web design. After graduating from Marquette University, I decided to shore up my development skills. I designed a few more static sites with Bootstrap then I decided to challenge myself to design responsive sites on my own. I did it and succeeded. The remaining problem was campatibility. Whilst I managed to design a visually compelling website, it was not compatible with IE 11. So that was my next step. I again took the extra miles, searched online, and that is how I designed the current website you’re seeing now. Of course, I designed a few other successful website templates as well. At the beginning of 2022, I learned about Jekyll, the most popular static site generator. This is yet another improvement to my static websites. Jekyll allows me to maintain my website easily. It’s a great to have feature for developers who want to manage static websites. And, wah lah! Here you go my latest website. Now, it’s time to push even further. Having now mastered the basics of responsive web design, it’s time to add icing on the cake - add animation and other features to my websites. It’s also time to learn WordPress development. WordPress is a good place to start learning dynamic web development. It has been a while since the last time I designed and built a fully functional dynamic web app. It’s time to refresh the skills and learn more about it. This is exactly what I’m going to do next. Following the previous announcements on making web development a lifetime passion and learning to design, construct and publish dynamic websites and web-based applications with WordPress, I must manage my time and resources well so that I have ample time to acquire these fascinating knowledge, tools and skills. To record my progress, I will update you my learning journey in this blog. You will see more about web programming here! "

    "body": "2022/01/19 - Gitee is China’s answer to GitHub. In the context of big power competition, China must have its own infrastruture to ensure economic security. The United States has been a leader in innovation and technology. Most software applications that you can name may come from this single country. Gitee and GitHub are both code hosting services. These platforms allow developers to collaborate on for-profit and not-for-profit projects that advance humanity and make technological innovation and advancement easier. In the past two years, the United States and its allies and partners have stepped up sanctions on China, including trade sanctions that deny Chinese companies access to critical infrastructure and resources originated from the United States. Gitee has grown in popularity over years, but it is still no competitor of GitHub. As a former Gitee user, I strongly believe that the ruthless censorship on its services is the biggest reason. Whilst the Chinese government is known for its reckless control over everything, Gitee has notably more restrictive rules than other Chinese internet platforms. My commits were rejected for no reason, and the error message was always “potentially sensitive language in code repository. ” Below is a code snippet that it claims to have “sensitive language” involved: &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;If the system continues to reject developers’ submissions, costing them more time and energy than necessary and making the service less usable, Gitee simply won’t succeed. Those who’re eager to support Made in China will inevitably be disappointed and discouraged because of these self-imposed arbitrary restrictions. The censorship on the platform has seriously undermined Gitee’s service quality and reputation. This why I reluctantly moved away from Gitee after closing my GitHub account and came to Bitbucket to host my website and projects. Lifting, or at least loosen, this censorship is the only way for Gitee to remain relevant and succeed. "

    "body": "2022/01/18 - Following the decision I made earlier on making web development a lifetime passion, I’m now beginning the learning of designing, constructing and publishing dynamic websites and web-based applications. I’ve accumulated some experience in building and maintaining static websites like this one. Now, it’s time to take further steps to acquire the knowledge, skills and tools needed to build dynamic, feature-rich Web sites and applications. Dynamic sites and apps are different from static websites and apps in a number of ways. They have more complex structures, require deeper understanding of web technologies, and they are powered by database and content management systems. WordPress is a popular content management system for dynamic websites and blogs. It runs on PHP, a back-end language that I learned in school. WordPress is widely used across industries from government, businesses, media to non-profits. Some high-profile websites that run on WordPress include the United States Department of State, the White House, Mozilla and the Time Magazine, etc. WordPress is perhaps the best place to get started. It has pre-designed templates, a rich library of plugins, and a vibrant global developer community. Therefore, I’ve decided to learn to design and create my very first WordPress site in the next couple of days. I will start by editing the default template to publish content, change the appearance and to add plugins. Then, I will move on to integrate my own templates, converting them into WordPress sites just as I did when I integrated Jekyll into my designs for static websites like this one. I believe this learning journey would be fruitful, and I will share my takeaways and experience in this blog. So, please keep in touch and continue to follow my website and blog! "

    "body": "2022/01/16 - Web development has become one of the few things that get me excited. The other two are data science and artificial intelligence. Since the web-based applications course opened me the door to the world of web development in the third year of college, I’ve been fascinated by the many opportunities that this world presents. Today’s world is more digitised than ever before. Most if not all successful individuals, businesses, organisations and governments run on data and are building presence in the digital world. After all, looking up information online has become an intuition of many people. After discovering that BitBucket can help me host static websites and blogs that are globally accessible, I decided to return to web development at the beginning of this year. I learned to build and deploy static websites with Jekyll, the popular static site generator, and made one of the templates that I designed last year accessible in all mainstream browsers, including the notorious Internet Explorer 11. Whilst I maintain the position that I won’t be a full-time web developer because I truly believe that I’m destined for something far more significant; undeniably, web development has become a part of me. I really enjoy designing stunning web applications, and I should let this passion guide me through the world of the Web. After much consideration, I have decided to further strengthen my coding skills by encouraging myself to take on more creative and challenging projects. Now, I can build blog sites, but web development can bring something much more practical and sophisticated. I will design a programme to help me systematically acquire the knowledge and tools of web development so that I’m equipped to build better, more useful and accessible web-based products and services. Perhaps, this can lead me to my very first business opportunity. "

As a current graduate trainee at HSBC, I can imagine how it was when John joined the organisation 30 years ago as a graduate trainee. Leadership is one of the many skills that I urgently need to develop as a professional. John’s decision to build the healthiest human system in the financial industry at HSBC still influences the organisation to this day. Mental health is indeed important to both leaders and colleagues. People are the critical enablers of strategies. For an organisation to sustain growth, it must treat its people well. John also talked about the ups and downs in his career. An interesting story I learned from him is that he almost resigned from HSBC in 2005. That’s something that I didn’t know. The story of how John went from a failed manager to cleaning up the chaos and his manager opened doors to leadership really intrigued me.

I had a hard time installing and using these plugins; however, perhaps that is because the official documentation on the Jekyll website isn’t clear enough for newbies like me. The plugin that I tried to install on my application is jekyll-paginate, which allows you to paginate your static blogs. I find this feature fascinating because it really helps simplying my static blog; otherwise, I really have no idea how you can efficiently manage a static site on which you’re going to publish a growing list of articles. In the Gemfile that you manually create in your application’s root directory, type in the following code: source 'https://rubygems. org'gem 'jekyll', '4. 2. 1'group :jekyll_plugins do	gem 'jekyll-paginate'endNote that the : at group :jekyll_plugins do is on the jekyll_plugins’s side. This is important. If you type group: jekyll_plugins do, you will likely get an error! Also it is a underscore mark instead of a hyphen in jekyll_plugins. After editing the Gemfile, you should also include in your _config. yml file the following code to intiate the plugins that you just installed: plugins:- jekyll-paginateNow you should open a command prompt and type in bundle install or simply bundle. After all these, you can now serve your site. BE CAREFUL!!! jekyll serve and bundle exec jekyll serve are not the same!!! This part wasted me hours to figure out. Since you installed the plugins with a Gemfile and bundle, you should always use bundle exec jekyll serv otherwise the plugin that you just installed won’t be effective in your app! "

    "body": "2022/01/08 - I’ve heared of Jekyll - the popular static site generator - for some time now. Whilst I got excited about the term “static site generator”, which wasn’t taught in school, I didn’t have a chance to try this technology out. This week, I finally got the chance. After discovering that BitBucket Pages is accessible in Mainland China, I decided to relaunch my website that was previously hosted on GitHub Pages - a web hosting platform that’s blocked in the People’s Republic of China. This site will be my personal branding platform that features my articles and projects. Since I’ve been busy with work, I decided to pick one of the templates that I designed last year and convert it into a Jekyll-powered site. As a front-end lover, I was sceptical about learning Jekyll because it’s based on Ruby and command lines. I had limited knowledge on both technologies. Whilst I’ve used GitHub for some time, I never actually learned to Git. These challenges got me excited but panic at the same time. My intuition told me to search on the Web, that’s what I do when I get stuck or don’t even know where to get started. So, I googled and found an amazing resource on CloudCannon Academy, which teaches you to convert any static template into a fully functional Jekyll site. Convert a static site to Jekyll I found this tutorial really helpful, and that’s how I built the site that you’re visiting now. Before using Jekyll, I had to copy and paste the header and footer to each and every webpage. Then I learned from W3Schools the server-side include technique. With Jekyll, the efficiency has been improved to another level. I didn’t feel like I used any Ruby or a lot of command lines when building this site, so if you’re also building a static website or blog, I highly recommend checking Jekyll and this resource out! "

    "body": "2022/01/05 - Time is a scarce resource. No one can claim to have enough time if he or she has great ambitions. How effective we can manage our time determines how significant the achievement we can accomplish in our lifetime. Undoubtedly, time management is an essential skill for both work and life.   How effective we can manage our time determines how significant the achievement we can accomplish in our lifetime.   How do we effectively manage our time? From my perspective, time management has four principles. These principles underpin every time management strategy that is considered effective. These principles are 1) leaving no second unused; 2) doing the right thing at the right time, 3) keeping track of progress and 4) learning from the past to prepare for the future. I will go over each of these and design an effective time management strategy that is based on these principles and works for both work and life.  Principle 1. Leaving no second unused : In theory, it’s impossible to “unuse” our time. Whether we work, eat or sleep, time flies by. It never pauses even a second for us to consider what to do. Leaving no second unused, putting it more accurately, is about using up every second available to do meaningful stuff. Meaningful tasks are items planned on our agenda. They usually produce long-term benefits. For example, instead of listening to music for an hour, we’d better off using this hour on something more meaningful such as learning a programming language or reading a well-written book.  Principle 2. Doing the right thing at the right time : (Source: Google Images) There’re two important concepts in this principle: the right thing and the right time. What is a right thing? A thing, or a task, is considered “right” if 1) it delivers tangible outcomes, 2) fit in the time, and 3) is placed on agenda. Simply put, the right thing is something of importance. What about the right time? A time is considered “right” if 1) it has been carefully planned and allocated, 2) it is measured, and 3) it is spent on something meaningful. In summary, doing the right thing at the right time is about doing what is important during the time allocated to this activity according to plan. To make this happen, we must understand our goals, prioritise these goals, and carefully allocate our available time to each goal based on significance.  Principle 3. Keeping track of progress : It’s proven true that learning from history can help us do better in the future. And the first step is to record history, tracking our performance. This is what this principle is about, very simple. We should know how well we have planned our time and executed this plan.  Principle 4. Learning from the past to prepare for the future : As mentioned, learning from the past can help us better prepare for the future. How much we can learn from history is how much we can improve for the future. I must seize every opportunity to learn, to grow, and strive to be at our best in whatever we do. This is how we make progress and become better.   How much we can learn from history is how much we can improve for the future.   As previously discussed, the principles listed shall underpin every strategy that is considered successful, effective at time management. There’re many techniques and tools can help us design and implement the strategy that delivers. This is what we’re going to do next after having gained a thorough understanding of the four principles.  Principles-based strategy : A principles-based strategy is a strategy embraces the four principles of time management. This time management strategy should leave no second unused (principle 1), demonstrate prioritisation and effective allocation of time (principle 2), provide tools to track progress (principle 3) and include reflection activities (principle 4).

    "body": "2022/01/05 - Since the birth of the internet, the world has been moving towards digitisation. And the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend in the past three years. As we become reliant on digital services for work and life and service providers start to recognise the value of data, we’re more exposed to all kinds of security risks than ever before. The stake can’t be higher. Service providers collect and analyse our data to personalise their products and services to better serve customers like you and me. Whilst appropriate acquisition and use of data can enhance products, services and customer experiences, misuse of data can put our interests and security at immense risk. We must be cautious when dealing with data and sceptical when choosing service providers.  Whilst appropriate acquisition and use of data can enhance products, services and customer experiences, misuse of data can put our interests and security at immense risk.  Being self-disciplined in the digital space is critical. It means 1) keeping track of our online activities, 2) knowing which services have access to our data, 3) understanding the level and type of risks we’re exposed to and 4) taking decisive action to confront security threats to protect our interests and security. We must recognise digital risks and actively monitor and mitigate them. Tracking online activities helps us understand what services have our data and to what extend they have access to this data. We must track how we’re using these services as well. Search engines like Baidu and Google may have stored our search queries, social media applications like WeChat and Tencent QQ may have access to our posts, conversations and possibly data from other applications on our devices, etc. Data like these are what service providers hunt for, and we must keep track of our digital footprint to identify threats. We must also be aware of the level and type of risk that we’re potentially exposed to. This will help us understand the risks and thereby making our risk mitigation strategies more effective. Services that do not have an account deletion feature can put our data at stake by having access to our data eternally; connected accounts can put our data at risk if any one of these accounts is compromised; email subscriptions can expose our data to risks if we lose our email accounts while automated system emails that contain our data continue to be sent to those accounts, etc. These types of risks will bring consequences of different levels. We must recognise, monitor and confront them in every possible way. The risk level ranked from low to high shall be texts &lt; images &lt; audios &lt; videos. We must know what types of data we’re supplying to each service. Public platforms expose us to greater risks than private platforms. Platforms are considered public if a broad, unknown audience has access to the posts published on the platforms. Baidu and Weibo are some of the most prominent public platforms. To protect our interests and security from harms, we shouldn’t post information that reveal ourselves on public platforms. By cautiously dealing with our data and actively taking steps to mitigate digital security threats, we can make our digital life more secure and rewarding. We must always prioritise our interests and security, keep our eyes wide open when dealing with our data and use only trusted services. "

    "body": "2021/10/07 - The Biden Administration appears to be sticking with ex-President Trump’s “Get Tough on China” policy. Since the U. S. -China relations rapidly declined under Trump’s trade war with China, the United States has sanctioned dozens of Chinese entities including Beijing, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong SAR government officials, P. R. C. government administrative bureaus, private companies, and state-run organizations. While the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China (MFA China) mentioned the possibility of establishing what it calls an “Unreliable Entities List” in response to U. S. sanctions, the Chinese government hasn’t made much visible progress on this pending regulation. It’s a good sign though that China passed the Anti-Sanctions Law in June 2021, but an Entity List, or even Entity Lists, is needed to secure China’s foreign policy and national security interests as well as the legally granted interests and rights of its private sector enterprises. While the U. S. frequently cites human rights and national security concerns when placing curbs on Chinese entities, the targets are mostly China’s national champions in technology. Taking into account the bills that the United States recently passed to designate the People’s Republic of China as a “strategic competitor” and push for competition with the Asian civilization, U. S. sanctions are undermining the interests of China’s foreign policy, national security, and economy. They’re merely targeting rights abusers but the tools that the U. S. utilizes to surpress China’s growing power. China needs entity lists to target malign actors that seek to undermine its interests. This should include both domestic (e. g. Apple Daily) and foreign (e. g. H&amp;M) entities. This’s the most effective way to demonstrate China’s resolve to confront foreign aggression and its ability to retaliate against the United States and others. Imposing costs on entities that are engaged in, or represent the risk of becoming engaged in, destablizing activities is absolutely necessary to saftguard China’s interests. China should not worry about foreign companies’ sentiment towards China. China must make it clear that friendly investors are more than welcomed, but malign actors are not welcomed on Chinese soil. We must always put national interests first. This is the redline that no one, not even the most generous investors, should be allowed to pass. "

Today, I’ve decided to use this platform to complete three projects at the beginner level to demonstrate my professional skills. Whilst I’m not a beginner data scientist, it’s been a long time since the last time I participate in a complex data analytics project. I created a Kaggle account a year ago but haven’t utilised thisplatform for learning data science. This is a perfect acid test to see how I can effectively use Kaggle to acquire knowledge and skills in the field of data science. I will follow Ken Jee’s YouTube videos to complete these beginner projects and post them on my Kaggle profile as well as this website. You will find more details with regard to this plan and the three projects in future articles as well as the Research section of this website. "

    "body": "2021/09/05 - Yesterday, I received an e-mail from DataCamp, which informed me that the platform has made three courses on SQL, Python and R temporarily free until 12 September 2021. DataCamp is an excellent online resource for learning data science. Perhaps, it’s even better than more popular MOOC platforms such as Coursera. DataCamp uses a scenario-based, hands-on approach to teach data science concepts and techniques. I believe this’s the most effective way for learning practical subjects such as data analysis. In the next couple of days, I will plan my schedule carefully to make sure that I fully utilise this period to complete all the three courses that are made free. This’s a great opportunity to learn data science using its platform and evaluate whether I should pay a subscription plan at DataCamp or even consider a full-time master’sdegree in data science back in the United States of America. As I continue to reflect on my career and plan for the future, I will post my thoughts on my website. I believe this thought process will help many people who may also have the same puzzle to solve. Please refer to the blog section of my website for these upcoming articles as well as the posts that I’ve already published on this topic. "

    "body": "2021/08/31 - Jardine Matheson has been one of my favourite companies since before my university graduation. This's also the only company that I tried and failed two times. Jardines hasa highly-selective executive trainee scheme that offers recent graduates with less than two years of full-time experience an opportunity to build a careeracross two or more industries within the group. Jardines is the largest employer in Hong Kong and has been in business for nearly 200 years. Last year, when I was still a university senior, I applied to the programme butwas placed on the final interview waitlist after completing two rounds of online assessments. This year, just a few weeks ago, I applied again. Yesterday, I received my second rejection letter. This time, I was not even considered for the final round. I learned a few lessons from this shameful experience. First, there is no guarantee that you will pass an interview even though it is your second attempt. When I received theassessments, I was excited and optimistic that I could win because the questions were unchanged. Therefore, I had a very high expectation for myself but also started to not taking the assessments seriously considering that this is my second time answering the questions. In hindsight, I should have treated the assessments seriously just as I did in the last time. Second, finish what you started with determination and caution. After getting shortlisted to take the second assessment, I was very happy and started to think I had a higher chance to win. Unfortunately, I allowed that milestone to take away my energy and patience. I didn't devote as much time and effort to the second assessmentas I did to the first assessment. Therefore, whilst I'm very disappointed to be rejected twice by Jardine Matheson, I also learned some valuable lessons from these failures. "

When these freedoms and rights are under pressure, we must take bold actionsto protect and preserve them. Robust debates and access to the free flow of information enable us to make progress together and build up stronger societies. We can't afford to allow any individual, business, organisation or government to gain advantage from asymetric information access. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has a long history of depriving the Chinese people of access to critical information that is viewed unfavourably by the party-state. Weas human beings need to see this fact and act to protect our interests and rights from the harm of information access denial. Here, I recommend two useful virtual private network (VPN) applications for getting what has been taken from us by the CCP government for a long time. A VPN allows peopleto bypass the notorious Great Fire Wall on the Chinese internet to gain access to applications and websites containing information that is blocked within the Chinese border. The first one is CyberGhost. Its Firefox extension is free for everyone. I recommend installing Firefox, making it your default browser and adding this extension to gain broaderinternet access from the Chinese mainland. DewVPN is an independent VPN application that you can install on your machine. Unlike a browser extension, all apps on your machine will be connected to the VPN service. You can download CCP-blocked apps such as Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp on your machine. By installing these software applications on your machines, you're helping to send a clear message to the CCP and malign actors that seek to harm instead of serving the interestsof people. You're standing up against the unjust and unwanted restrictions imposed on you and the people who you care about. "

    "body": "2021/08/27 - The world is such a diverse place. We simply can’t expect every person to hold the same opinion on every issue. Therefore, we mustlearn to respect and understand others’ perspectives whilst defending our own positions. Having spent four years in the United States, this’s one of the most valuable lessons I learned on that journey. Western and Orientalcivilisations are different in a lot of ways. Our histories shape the way we think and act. The United States and China have different opinions on a wide range of issues spanning politics, technology and religions, etc. These differences are playing a pivotal role in shaping the U. S. -China relationship and the world order. Whilst I made a lot of friends while I was studying there, we held different opinions on a lot of social issues. Coming froma Communist society, it’s hard to convince me that God exists with just a few theology lectures. As a PRC citizen studyingabroad, I also got defensive when Americans claimed that the coronavirus was man-made and released from a virology lab in Wuhan, blaming my country for this pandemic. It’s important to be a good listener and defender at the same time. Being a good listener means to stay calm and process the informationthat others present. We shall listen with the intent to understand but not to persuade others to buy into our own perspectives. Whilst we don’t necessarily have to accept others’ ideas, we should still listen, think critically, and decide if they’re making valid points. It’s important to show respect so that we can keep the conversation healthy and fruitful. We should not assume everyone should hold the same opinion although some ideas may sound insane or even offensive. ideas sound. We must also be fearless defenders. We must keep faith in our beliefs and the decisions we make. If we’re certain that we made valid points and our	opinions are supported by reasoning, then we should defend them – explain clearly how we reached the conclusions and why we hold these opinions. We need to gather ideas from different sources to broaden our horizens, learn from differences, and make sure that our perspectives are heard, shared and discussed in the conversations. If we believe in our ideas while others continue to refuse to accept them, we should give them some time and keep in mind that we’re not theultimate authority. Every person has the right to process information and formulate their own stances. It’s time to pause and move on to other topics. It’s more persuasive and powerful to prove our ideas with bold actions than having endless debates and disagreements. "

For years, Japanese invaders bombed Chinese cities, stole wealth and resources from the Chinese homeland and relentlessly murdered countless civilians across China and the Asia-Pacific region. The world is still waiting for Japan’s sincere apology over its inhumane practices. Whilst the World War II is fading away, we the peace-loving Chinese people must remain cautious about potential military conflicts in East and South China seas, the Taiwan Strait and the Himalaya border with India. The increasingly aggressive United States of America and its traditional and emerging partners and allies are posing legitimate national security and military threats to our beloved motherland. Our familities live here, we must do whatever it takes to defend against foreign aggression. We need both pride and humility when looking at China’s 5,000 years of civilisation. This’s what we’re most proud of as a people. We can learn a lot from history and become better in the future. It’s clear that the Japanese didn’t surrend because of China’s military strength but the nuclear bomb that the United States launched to retaliate Japanese attack on the Perl Harbor. As we identify and confront emerging threats in the region, we need to revitalise our economy from the impact of COVID-19, reform our somewhat rigid education system, mordernise our nuclear and military capabilities and start actively engage in international affairs from the perspectives of national interests and security. We need a diplomatic strategy that puts China first and measure by quality instead of purely quantity. Lithuania has made a huge mistake to allow the Taipei government to open a what it calls “Taiwan Office” in its territories. This’s clearly against the One China Policy that the country agreed to uphold when it established ties with Beijing. This act has seriously eroded the foundation based on which the China-Lithuania Relationship is founded upon and China’s national interests and security. It’s time to end diplomatic ties with a few Western countries under the guidance of the United States to demonstrate China’s resolve to confront foreign aggression. "

I haven’t made much visible progress in terms of cross-browser compatibility, more sophisticated JavaScript programs, back-end development and responsive layout, etc. It’s time to change. It’s time to adopt a more focused approach to learning web application development rather than measuring progress by quantity only.

This’s the first time the Biden Administration approves arms sales to the island at the centre of geopolitical disputes between the People’s Republic of China (PRC or China) and the United States of America (U. S. A. or United States). Since the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) retreated to Taiwan, the disputes across the strait had never stopped. Whether Republicans or Democrats are in charge of the White House, U. S. arms sales to Taiwan has continued to this day. The Chinese Civil War had never ended because no peace resolution had ever come in place. With the 1992 Consensus between the leaders of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan falling apart and U. S. pivoting to the Indo-Pacific region, peaceful reunification between the two is increasingly unlikely. China has made it absolutely clear that if a peaceful reunification becomes impossible either because Taipei Government’s push for independence or foreign influence operations in Taiwan, the Chinese Civil War will ressume in the form of military confrontation. With the tensions between China and the United States intensifying across a wide range of issues, U. S. arms sales to Taiwan and coalition against Beijing are unlikely to stop. It’s up to the Chinese people on the mainland and Taiwan to prevent wars from happening again in this region. People are peace-loving in nature. No one wants to see military conflicts next door. However, we want lasting peace but not peace under geopolitical pressure. The United States has military buildups around the world. It has military bases in South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. Now it’s getting closer and closer to the Chinese claimed island of Taiwan. We the people in the region should advocate for lasting peace. And, we should fight back with resolve when lasting peace becomes increasing unlikely under foreign influence. "

It isn’t just a software for documenting information, performing calculations or making some basic charts. It can be used to build dynamic financial models and user form applications - with the help of VBA of course. VBA is a programming language designed for Excel and other Microsoft programs. You can actually write code in Excel to automate tasks. While you can’t build powerful applications such as Facebook and Photoshop with Excel, Excel-based applications are extremely useful in operations management. There’re a few reasons. First, while your company may not have purchased more sophisticated application development toolkit like Visual Studio, you’re very likely to have Excel with other Microsoft Office Suite software programs pre-installed on your corporate laptop. As I said before, Excel is the most popular spreadsheet software in the world, and I don’t see any other product has the power to challenge its position in the market. Second, Excel looks much more intuitive than other development tools. It is a spreadsheet software made up of rows and columns. Unlike Visual Studio and Eclipse, you don’t need to work hard to set up an environment before you can get work done. Third, Excel applications can run on all Excel programs as long as you enable the Macros. You can also use Macros to write VBA code without having to write the code line by line yourself. How do Excel applications fit into operations management? You can use it to build interactive dashboards to assess risks and benefits of each project you plan to proceed with, you can build tracking systems to standardise the workflow so that all employees are following a fixed set of steps or maybe use it to build some smart tools to enter data into existing systems, etc. In the next two days, I will learn to build some smart tools with Excel and VBA to build a tracking system to make sure my fellow colleagues to follow a standard operating procedure.

    "body": "2021/08/04 - Journaling is the best way to document anything you want. There’re a lot of ways to write journals – you can use texts, images, comics, audios and videos, etc. Whatever way you wish to do it, the most important thing amongst all is that you need to understand clearly why and what you wish to write about. I think an office journal is helpful for setting objectives and goals, reflecting on the past and planning for the future. What’s an office journal? I made up this term. An office journal is a periodic journal about your career. It offers the opportunity to pause and think carefully about your career. By setting clear objectives and goals, you can energise yourself by targeting what you desire in workspace. The growth momentum will build up if you’re clear about what you want out of work each day, week, month and year. This’s how I would write an office journal. I would create a dedicated folder for my journals. I would name this folder “office-journal”. Inside the folder, I would create two sub-folders – “daily-reflection” and “career-weekly”. As the names suggest, “daily-reflection” will be the place where I reflect on each day, and “career-weekly” is where I reflect on each week. Each time I create an entry, I would name the entry with the date on which I create it. I would set clear objectives in the morning and come back to summarise my progress at the end of the day to see how I performed on that day. Similarly, I would name my weekly journals with the dates on which I create them and carefully reflect on the past week and set some broad goals for the coming week. A well-written, thoughtful office journal should help with your career progression. This’s what I plan to do to keep learning and growing. Journaling is a continuous effort. It requires persistence. I will remind myself of creating these journals every morning and catch up if I fail to do so. Missing a few entries is acceptable, but it’s important to keep the momentum growing by adjusting your direction when you realise that you’re running off the track. "

I’ve been writing about this job long before joining this global financial institution. Yesterday, 30 July 2021, I concluded my first week as an HSBC employee. Now, I’d like to share my first impression of the bank as a Chinese-based new joiner. I can tell HSBC is investing heavily in management trainees like me. The Guangzhou branch welcomed five trainees in total this year. HSBC has three office buildings in Guangzhou – my home city. I joined the group from its Taikoo Hui office. Taikoo Hui is a mix-used property located at the heart of downtown Guangzhou. I’m privileged to have this opportunity to join the bank as a graduate trainee. Since the HSBC building is connected to a metro station, I spend ninety minutes taking underground to work every morning. The metro station is located at the lobby of the building, thus it’s very convenient to commute via underground trains. We didn’t do much on the first day of work. We arrived at the lobby at 9 AM in the morning, filled out some forms and one of the human resource managers led us to the IT helpdesk to get our laptops ready. We also toured our offices and met with the line managers who will be responsible for our first rotation in the programme. We had daily meetings after work with trainees from other countries such as India, Mexico, Poland, and the United Kingdom. HSBC sets a very high standard for every trainee the company recruits from top universities around the world. It expects us to be the bank’s future leaders. The organisation is far larger than I thought. The entire 17-storey building belongs to the bank. The organisation also owns properties across the Greater China Region and the globe. HSBC assigns employees into hierarchical bands. Management trainees are Level 6 employees, which are equivalent to department managers. The company provides trainings to all new joiners in various formats including MOOC and meetings. Since our business is global, we need to co-operate with colleagues from across the world. I had to meet with colleagues working from different time zones. The ability to work on a flexible schedule is critical at HSBC. I’m overwhelmed because I’ve never worked at an organisation with such a large scale, and I get to manage employees who’re more experienced than me as a business manager. Many of my co-workers have years of experience in banking and master’s degrees from prestigious universities. I left with my first assignment which will be due in two weeks. Next week, I will participate in the global graduate induction via Zoom in which I will meet with trainees from other countries and the Group Chief Executive Mr Noel Quinn. I’m both excited and nervous about these events. In the coming weeks, I will focus on learning the business, acquiring knowledge and skills and successfully delivering my first project. "

In June 2021, the PRC passed its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law to address foreign influence in China’s policy and foreign sanctions on PRC officials and entities. This is the first time that the PRC cites this law when it retaliate against the United States sanctions. It is expected that the PRC to apply this new law in future responses to foreign aggression as well. Whilst it is unclear when, if possible, the disputes between the PRC and the United States will be resolved, it is clear that Beijing is ready to stand up against an increasingly aggressive United States in the Indo-Pacific region.

    "title": "Joining HSBC as Global Operations Graduate Trainee in Guangzhou",
    "body": "2021/07/24 - Today is the last Saturday before I officially join the HSBC Group as a Global Operations Graduate Trainee. This is a milestone in my career. It is my first full-time job after university graduation. I think this is the right time to pause for a moment to reflect on the past and look into the future. In the past four years, I spent most of my time on the Marquette University campus in Milwaukee, WI where I studied finance and information systems and obtained my bachelor’s degree. The world has been largely changed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing U. S. -China dispute over a wide range of issues. The only certainty has been uncertainty. I couldn’t anticipate where I would end up at even just two months ago. I’m grateful. I’m tremendously proud of what I’ve achieved so far. I’m grateful for this opportunity to join one of the largest financial institutions in the world as a management trainee. I’m grateful because not many people have the privilege to work from home, stay with family, and get a decent salary on the first job after graduation. I believe my HSBC experience will be colourful. It’ll make my resume stand out from my peers and help me open more doors of opportunity. Now, let’s look at the job itself. HSBC’s Global Operations Graduate Programme is a rotational programme that offers final-year students and recent graduates the opportunity to build an international career and learn about one of the largest financial institutions in the world. The programme will allow me to work in four different business areas within the bank and grow my knowledge base and skills on this journey. This is a unique opportunity that I must capture and utilise wisely. Before joining the bank, we’ve had a couple of Zoom meetings with the 2020 cohort of the programme and met some senior managers in different business services across Asia, Europe and North America. This is a truly global organisation. From those conversations, I learned more about life at HSBC. Many speakers from the 2020 cohort emphasised the importance of time management. Indeed, this is a very critical skill that everyone should master in order to maximise the value of scarce resources including time. My first assignment at HSBC is with the Credit Service department at HSBC’s Global Service Centre in Guangzhou, China – my home city. I will join the wholesale credit operations team and help the bank improve its operational efficiency and customer experience. While I don’t know what exactly my responsibility will be at this moment, I can start learning to prepare for my role. Indeed, I’ve been doing so since day one. I believe it’s critical to keep learning to seize future opportunities and make the most out of each rotation in the programme. This’s a new start. University life is just history now. Nobody knows what the future will be like, neither do I. But I have set a couple of objectives and goals for the next six months with the Credit Service department. My goal is to learn as much as possible from each rotation. It’s that simple. I believe simpler, clearer goals are the most effective ones. So, I’ll just leave my goal in this one sentence – to learn as much as possible from each rotation. Now, below are my objectives. To achieve goals like this, I need to break it down and set some smaller, more specific and manageable goals, aka objectives. I’ve set three objectives to help me attain this goal. The first objective is to get to know new and old colleagues and establish connections with them. HSBC is such a huge and globalised organisation that networking has become an imperative. I need to see this and act on it to make sure I’m well prepared to take on more responsibilities as I advance in my career at the bank. This can be done through either face-to-face conversations or virtual meetings via technology. HSBC has created a rich on-line community to facilitate networking within the company. I must utilise every tool and opportunity available to connect with people, share my experience and learn from these great people. The second objective is to ask as many questions as possible to get to know my responsibilities and the broader business of HSBC. Asking is the most effective way to demonstrate one’s enthusiasm and learn new things. Whenever I’m in doubt, I can consult the two mentors assigned to me, my line manager and colleagues. There’s no shortage of support, but it’s all up to me to utilise them. Additionally, as a management trainee, I need to understand the broader business. I must stay at the forefront of everything we do to make the right decisions for the company. I must be open-minded and focus not only on my required tasks but also the needs of the bank. This’s not a regular job. It’s a programme that is designed to produce bank managers of the future. HSBC expects me to be a leader, so I must act like one. My final objective is to keep learning after work. It’s important to invest as much time as possible in learning new things not only for the sake of work but also for personal development. My competitors won’t be turning on the sleep mode whilst we’re not at work. I must stay ahead of them by learning as much as possible. I need to be clear about my short-and-long-term goals and plans all the time. These three objectives should help me achieve the goal of learning as much as possible from each rotation in the programme. I will review this plan at the end of my first rotation in March 2022. Whilst it’s difficult to stick to a plan, I will be more nimble and agile in adapting new changes with than without a plan. "

    "body": "2021/07/18 - Statistics is at the heart of data science. Business analysts and data scientists use statistics to explore data sets, draw conclusion from samples to reflect populations, and transform raw data into actionable insights. To succeed as a business analyst or a data scientist, I must grasp the fundamentals of statistics before diving into R and Python programming. As mentioned in a previous post, I’m using Practical Statistics for Data Scientists 50 Essential Concepts Using R and Python to study R and Python applications in statistics and data science. However, I realised that this book does not fully cover every statistical concept like a traditional textbook. Therefore, I’m looking for a statistics textbook to aid my studies. Marin Stats Lectures (https://statslectures. com) is a great resource for learning statistics and R. However, I think a textbook will allow me to learn and review statistical concepts systematically. I believe it’s crucial to learn stuff in a systematic manner. In college, I learned statistics for business and economics using a textbook with the same name. I plan to revisit this book to fill the gaps in statistics. I will also look for additional resources online to help me practise the application of statistics. "

    "body": "2021/07/17 - Today, the United States sanctioned dozens of Chinese and Hong Kong SAR government officials over the National Security Law passed and implemented in 2020. It also issued a business advisory to warn companies about the associated risks of doing business in the Chinese territory under the law. The U. S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, like many U. S. officials including President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. highlighted the arrests at Apple Daily and its subsequent closure. Before talking about the National Security Law, we should understand why it was implemented last year, not before. In 2019, a Hong Kong couple visited Taiwan, China. The husband murdered his wife and fled back to Hong Kong. Since there is no extradition treaty between Hong Kong and other areas of China, which is ridiculous considering the fact that Hong Kong had extradition treaty with many foreign countries including the United States, the Hong Kong and Chinese officials believed that an extradition bill is needed to protect the interests and rights of the people and bring criminals to justice. This proposed, never passed extradition bill triggered waves of debates, demonstrations, and later vandalism in the international city. Many corrupted government officials and criminals are hiding in Hong Kong. Hong Kong provided a shield for those who seek to undermine the interests of the public. Western countries such as the United States and United Kingdom are actively engaged in colour revolution in the Chinese city. The proposed extradition bill exposed many of these individuals and organisations. Many local and foreign companies in the city were adversely impacted by the civil unrests. For example, Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flagship carrier reported significant declines in inbound and outbound passenger numbers long before COVID-19 hit the city. The airline made it clear that those declines were attributable to the protests. Almost all major companies operating in Hong Kong later issued statements to call on the return of the rule of law and protection of their properties from the violent protestors. The National Security Law did just that. The United States seems to be very concerned about the “deteriorating” situation in Hong Kong. The fact is that there have been more U. S. companies and travellers in Mainland China than Hong Kong for many years. If the United States isn’t concerned about the situation in the remainder of China, why would it focus on Hong Kong’s situation other than geopolitical ambitions in the region considering the country has designated the People’s Republic of China as a strategic competitor?Responsible Chinese citizens from both the mainland and Hong Kong should think carefully about the unspoken facts about these U. S. actions. Hong Kong remains a highly-ranked financial centre for international trade. Last year, dozens of technology companies went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The National Security Law didn’t hold companies back from seeking the benefits that Hong Kong provides. With the growing Chinese market, Hong Kong will remain as an important hub for international investment. "

    "body": "2021/07/13 - Patriotism is a virtue that every responsible citizen should seek and uphold. Patriots support their countries by purchasing goods and services produced in their countries, joining the public service sector or the military, and rejecting foreign aggressions that undermine the interests of their countries. When it comes to cross-border friendships; however, we need a carefully measured approach to fulfill our patriotic duties. Let me be clear: patriotism remains important at all time. But when you have friends from other countries who may have gone through a completely different value education or whose countries may have interest conflicts with your country, you need to be mindful about the impact on your friendship of your patriotism. I’m a People’s Republic of China (PRC) citizen. The PRC is the largest Socialist country in the world and considered a strategic competitor of the United States of America (United States). In the past four years, I pursued my bachelor’s degree in the United States and made some U. S. friends during that time. I have a good friend from Chicago who considers himself a conservative American. Those who’ve been paying attention to the news can see American Conservatives are largely against virtually everything about the PRC simply because it has a polar opposite ideology. Indeed, my Chicago friend agreed with almost every single policy in Trump’s strategy towards the PRC while I utterly disagreed with every single PRC-related policy in Trump’s “America First” foreign policy framework. Like many Chinese patriots, I support my country through buying and promoting Made in China, publicly reject Western propaganda that seeks to defame China but not only the Communist Party in Beijing, and even cut ties with some American students who’re radically conservative. However, my patriotism, which is right and needed, has put pressure on our friendship because we represented different ideals, interests, and peoples. This’s exactly why we need to be cautious when we demonstrate our patriotism in cross-border frienships. I’ve indeed lost some friends because of my patriotism. I wouldn’t say I regret it, but that’s certainly not what I want as a result of fulfilling my patriotic responsibilities. I need to change my patriotic image so that I can fulfill my responsibilities as a citizen without hurting my cross-border friendships. It’s much better and less radical to focus on presenting and promoting the strengths of my country than hitting straight back at the pain points on which I have polar opposite opinions from my friends. I should talk about the convenient transportation system and infrastructure of the PRC rather than the battle between Socialism and Capitalism or atheism and theism. I must avoid bringing up the conflicts between the PRC and United States in front of my U. S. friends but take real actions to help my country grow better and stronger until it defeats all its enemies. It’s more patriotic to act to address your country’s problems than simply talking about it and letting this type of conversation ruin your cross-border relationships. "

However, I still believe that a new research website is necessary for tracking my progress and sharing knowledge.

    "body": "2021/07/12 - Let’s tell the truth - the Chinese Communist Party’s censorship is doing a serious disservice to all the Chinese companies that are working so hard to serve the Chinese people and people around the world well. As a developer, I’ve been using GitHub for a long time, but I want to support Chinese platforms. OSChina, which stands for Open-Source China, is arguably the most popular code hosting service in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). I registered an account on the platform and tried it out. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to drop GitHub and support Made in China, I was unable to do so because of the internet censorship. Nine out of ten times, I encountered issues related to censorship on the platform. OSChina disallowed me to upload my code files due to what it calls “potentially sensitive expressions”. What’s even worse is that this ambiguous error message provided me with no hint to correct the errors and make my programs work and sharable on the platform. Usually, bad user experiences like this on Chinese platforms are not attributable to the companies themselves but the stringent, sometimes inhumane, censorship rules that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) imposes on them with the absolute authority that it secured since the founding of the PRC. I repeat: the CCP’s censorship is the culprit behind the bad user experience and the criminal who’s making PRC companies much less attractive to customers and therefore less competitive than foreign players. Not the Chinese people who build up the platforms and provide the services. Many people would agree with me on this issue and acknowledge this obvious truth. No one; however, especially those who have China-based investments to take care of, has the courage to speak out against these unjust rules and laws. If the CCP-controlled Chinese government continues to impose restrictions on PRC companies and limit the activities of their customers, PRC companies simply cannot and will not succeed or merit the same level of respect that global companies like Google, Apple, and Adobe receive. The PRC government censorship is much worse than any U. S. sanction imposed on PRC companies. The censorship rules are harming PRC companies more than any foreign sanction. Many globally successful companies including Twitter, Facebook, and Google are operating without the Chinese market. They’re successful because they understand and respect the freedoms and rights that are given to every person at birth. There’re countless PRC citizens bypassing the notorious Great Fire Wall to see what the real world is about on the global platforms that are blocked in the PRC. They look for facts that are censored and inaccessible on PRC platforms. People seek freedoms and rights whenever it is possible not because of voracity; rather, they’re simply looking for what’s taken away from them involuntarily. Every human being is entitled with these freedoms and rights. If the CCP doesn’t lift its restrictions on PRC firms. China, Inc. will never win the market not because of export restrictions but the freedoms-and-rights-killing rules that the Chinese government imposes on them. "

Now, I’d like to share my study plan for this mission. Professors at universities would hand out course syllabi on the first day of class. I believe in the importance of syllabi. They lay out neatly how courses are structured, what expectations are for students, and how students should be assessed at the end of the courses. Therefore, I’m going to design a course syllabus to aid my learning of Excel and project management. I think a syllabus is needed because it helps me to stay organized and make sure I complete learning before my first day at HSBC. I’ve learned Excel in school. I will focus on the tough parts which are PivotTable, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and perhaps, VBA. The speakers on our Wednesday meeting highlighted these features in Excel, which are very handy on the job as an operations manager at HSBC. I’ll find tutorials - either in video or written format - and download some data sets from Kaggle to practise the use of these Excel features. I believe the best way to learn Excel is to get data and practise with them. For project management, I’ll focus on the principles, models, and tools. Since I’ve not learned PM systematically before, I will need to take some time to learn this material. I’ve found two books and a piece of software tool. The two books are Project Management: Achieving Competitive Advantage by Jeffrey K. Pinto and Microsoft Project 2019 Step by Step written by Cindy Lewis, etc. The software is, as you might have guessed it right, Microsoft Project. These books and software are used at Marquette University to teach the project management course for information systems students. I believe I should try these out to learn PM as well.

Baidu APPs are also imposing arbitrary restrictions on certain user activities. For instance, when users post anything critical of Baidu’s products on their profiles, the applications would remove those comments without giving any notice. Any politically sensitive comments would also be removed. Companies that do not accept the most genuine feedback from users simply cannot be good by any standard. Baidu APPs also have stringent rules that limit users’ freedoms. For example, the applications do not allow users to change their usernames or require subscription to do so.  	CSDN, OSChina, and Gitee are engaged in coersive tactics in account management. I found these applications are deceiving users to create accounts through third-party applications, which are usually social media services. Many users have created accounts on these platforms without knowing it. These applications also lack convenient venues for users to download and delete their data and leave the platforms. Additionally, they are as well imposing arbitrary restrictions on user activities. Gitee, for example, has blocked dozens of words and phrases that are deemed politically sensitive. The algorithm that the service use to detect these words and phrases; however, frequently misunderstands users’ expressions. These restrictions have imposed considerable costs on users. Moving forward, I will continue to identify malicious software applications and share them on my website. I urge each of you to establish an Internet Security Entity List to identify and prevent the use of applications that you believe to have endangered your freedom, privacy, and security online. "

It does not come naturally to most people, and that is why we need to habituate it – make it a habit with willpower. Luckily, time management is acquirable through habituation, and many people have succeeded in habituating time management. Most people waste time on trivial things such as YouTube videos and computer games not because they fail to recognise the importance of time management, but they lack the framework and willpower to transform their lifestyle. While I still have a long journey before I can effectively manage my time, I have made visible progress in the past few weeks. I started using Excel to plan my day before acting. Planning is a good virtue, and I have habituated it through repetition. It does not matter whether I can successfully deliver my plans on this stage.

    "body": "2021/07/02 -   Today, I finished watching A Quiet Place Part II. This is one of my favourite horror films. I watched Part I one or two years ago. The fact that I still remember the details from the previous film without having to rewatch it shows that A Quiet Place is an excellent series. I encourage everyone to watch it at night with friends andlights off!Part II, just like the previous film, is horrific. After the father sacrificed himself to save the family at the end of Part I, the rest of the family resumed their journey. Now they have a newborn crying baby. Family remains the biggest element of the film because everything - every decision that the protagonists make is about the family. This is a very special film - as the title suggests - it is very quiet throughout. Since any noice can trigger alien attacks, it is necessary but not always easy for the characters to stay quiet. The ending is “OK” because I feel like something is cut off. However, I hope that the sequel, Part III, will round up everything neatly. I will definitely watch in theatres when the third episode come out in 2023! "

    "body": "2021/06/06 - Finally! I’ve gotten XAMPP to run on my laptop. I’ve also installed WordPress via Bitnami. This’s the first time I build dynamic websites locally. XAMPP is designed for this purpose and is recommended by many professional developers. In the next few weeks, I plan to explore this software program, learn to use it to develop database-driven websites locally, and use it to learn WordPress development. With XAMPP, I’m enabled to learn web development and relational database modelling at the same time. While setting up a local environment can take a lot more work, it worths the time and effort because it is much safer to develop software components locally before deploying them in the final product. This is an industrial standard. It is a good practice that every professional should pursue. In doing so, it is less likely to create errors and troubles for site visitors and users. There’re indeed many ways to use WordPress in web development. I can download a starter template and edit the site from there or starting from scratch. My current website hosted on GitHub Pages is static, meaning that I have to manually create, publish, and edit each page not only the posts but also the design, which includes the images, colours, and layouts. My goal is to transform my static website into a MySQL-backed dynamic WordPress website. By incorporating WordPress, I can automate the repetitive steps in web editing and use the CMS to maintain my website more efficiently. Let me be clear: my career goal remains the same - I want to be a business analyst or a data scientist but not a web developer or a software engineer. I will learn XAMPP and WordPress as my hobby. I only learn web technologies to build my personal websites. MySQL, on the other hand, is closely aligned with the careers that I want. Therefore, I will also leverage XAMPP and WordPress to develop my SQL and relational modelling skills. As I continue to explore these software tools, I will post more to my website. Perhaps, I will rent a custom domain to host my website after incorporating the WordPress CMS. Please check my website regularly for updates. "

    "title": "Business Analytics VS Computer Science - Who Wins the Final Round?",
    "body": "2021/05/20 - In a previous post (the “Post”), I discussed my path forward after graduating college. While I was certain about pursuing a master’s degree for the sake of career advancement, I was undecisive between business analytics and computer science. In this article, I would like to extend on that conversation to try reach a conclusion. Business analytics is a business school program. Considering my background in finance and information systems, business analytics appears to be a better choice than computer science because it integrates analytical and technical skills. In business analytics, not only you learn to perform technical tasks, but also to interpret the results, which is arguably, more important than number crunching itself. Therefore, I decided to consider business analytics an option. Computer science, on the other hand, is an art and science program. Some universities also categorize computer science as an engineering discipline. Unlike business analytics, this is what I call a “purely technical” degree. That is, computer science puts much heavier emphasis on technology than business analytics. In business analytics, you learn a lot about business including marketing, management, and accounting in addition to SQL, R, and Python; however, in computer science, you spend all the time learning operating systems, programming languages, and algorithms. I fell in love with technology since the first time I code in an information systems class. I was so passionate about technology; therefore, I also consider computer science an option. After consulting with my professors, the internet, and my parents and asking myself “what do I want to achieve” for a few times, I have decided to pursue computer science. As mentioned in the Post about the difference between the Chinese and American job markets, Chinese companies tend to favour “technologists with business knowledge” but not “analysts with technical know-how”. China is an emerging economy. It is growing faster than the rest of the world. This means it is more likely to encounter issues in China ahead of other countries. These issues present challenges but also opportunities. Having spent four years in the United States, while I appreciate the American ideal of freedom of speech and so on, China is where the future lies. I strongly believe in China’s potential – not because it is my home country, but it is a fact that even Western powers cannot deny. Thus, to prepare for my transition back into the Chinese economy, I must equip myself with a solid technical foundation. After spending four years at a business school, I believe I already have the managerial and analytical mindset necessary to be successful in business. Conclusively, I will spend the next couple of months, even years, to prepare for my graduatelevel education in computer science. Since I come from a business background, I received much less technical training than computer science undergraduates even though I majored in information systems. Therefore, I expect to see obstacles on my journey ahead, but I will not and cannot afford to back down because computer science is the way to go. I must be prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal. This is imperative because after leaving college, I will be the only driver of myself. I must motivate myself to act and not only to think about the future. In the next post in this series, I will discuss what I plan to do to prepare for a graduate-level education in computer technology. "

    "title": "Communication is the Solution to People Issues",
    "body": "2020/12/29 - You probably have heard of it many times that communication is the answer to most problems in a collaborative environment. As an information systems student, I learned this through projects in a hard way. I believe successes and failures all deserve reflections. They should be openly discussed. In this article, I want to share my thoughts on communication based on my project experience. In the summer of 2020, I agreed to help a friend who had little to no web development experience to build a website for a client based in Atherton, California. I agreed to do so for two reasons – first, he was my best friend at that time; and second, I wanted to put my coding skills into practice. With COVID-19 spreading rapidly across the states in the summer, we collaborated on Teams throughout the process. Obviously, I learned a lot from that project, but I want to concentrate on communication in this article because we had some serious communication-related issues. I learned three lessons. Lesson 1: Make a plan but expect it to run off tracks Every project requires a plan for team members to work closely and keep moving forward. However, it is critical to expect that things may not go as planned, which is usually the case. As the only team member with the necessary technical competencies, I played a pivotal role that essentially managed all aspects of the website. While I was assigned to build back-end applications to collect and analyze data, I was forced to write some front-end code as well because my friend was still learning to code, and he made quite a lot of mistakes…usually the same ones. I was frustrated because that was not how we planned. I got to work extra hours but received the same paycheck. I reflected on what happened. It is true that things fell apart, but – Is it a surprise that as the only technician on the team I got to work longer hours? Is it my friend’s fault to have repeated the same mistakes as a beginner in web development? The answers are no. So, what went wrong? Nothing went wrong but communication. Instead of bringing up our feelings on team meetings, we chose to keep them to ourselves, which did not help remove negativities but helped them grow. Eventually, they exploded and adversely impacted the team’s progress. We ended up blaming each other based our own perspectives – I complained about how he repeated those mistakes based on the assumption that we should follow the plan, and he is able to pick up front-end skills as quickly as I did, and he blamed me for not offering enough help based on the assumption that just because I am more technically capable, he could leave all those code issues for me to fix. That is not how things should have worked. Instead of keeping these negativities to ourselves, we should have openly discussed them. The only way to fix these issues is communication. We were not supposed to keep those feelings private because of the fear that these negativities may ruin the cooperation. In fact, those issues are part of our cooperation. If I face this issue again, I will bring it up as soon as possible so it does not stick with the team. Lesson 2: Always communicate with the goal of fixing problems instead of just throwing out personal feelings We oftentimes draw an equal sign between communication and expression, but from my perspective, that is not the case. We want to express our feelings through communication, but communication should not stop there. We must understand that other people are not trash cans for holding negativities. When we have concerns, we should raise them up and fix them. The goal of communication should always be fixing problems instead of shooting negativities at others. I learned this from the project as well. When the negativities exploded, we started badmouthing. I labeled him as a web rookie and blamed me as a loose cannon. We expressed our feelings, but there was no sincere and constructive communication. We did not realize it for a while, and those blame games solved no issues at all. In hindsight, we could have done much better by expressing our feelings, expecting others would not immediately accept those perspectives, and trying to fix the issues and stop them for good through constructive communication. Communication goes beyond expression to address issues. Lesson 3: Expect to communicate multiple times Communication is a lasting process. We should not expect to solve problems with only one or two chats. Instead, we should expect to communicate repeatedly. While this sounds annoying, it is necessary. This is the third lesson I learned from that project. We are not controllers of other people’s minds, so we should expect the result of communication to be different from what we expected. While our goal is to deliver the favorable result, it may not come with first few rounds of communication. It is crucial to understand problem solving does not require imposition of one-sided perspectives. It is an exchange process because every person on the team is unique and has something different from yours. When you communicate, make sure that the goal is to solve issues, not necessarily persuading others to buy in your opinions. I think these lessons are helpful for me and for you all as well.

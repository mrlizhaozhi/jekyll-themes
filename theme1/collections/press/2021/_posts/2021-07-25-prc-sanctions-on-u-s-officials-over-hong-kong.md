On 23 July 2021, the People's Republic of China (PRC) sanctioned seven United States politicians and entities over the business advisory with regard to the situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (Hong Kong) and U.S. sanctions on seven PRC central government officials in Hong Kong earlier this month.
<br><br>
The PRC sanctions targeted dozens of U.S. officials behind the issuance of the business advisory and the decision to sanction PRC officials, including the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. from the Trump Administration as well as non-governmental organisations and U.S. government agencies working on a range of China-related issues.
<br><br>
These sanctions are symbolic and impactful. In June 2021, the PRC passed its <i>Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law</i> to address foreign influence in China's policy and foreign sanctions on PRC officials and entities. This is the first time that the PRC cites this law when it retaliate against the United States sanctions.
<br><br>
It is expected that the PRC to apply this new law in future responses to foreign aggression as well. Whilst it is unclear when, if possible, the disputes between the PRC and the United States will be resolved, it is clear that Beijing is ready to stand up against an increasingly aggressive United States in the Indo-Pacific region.

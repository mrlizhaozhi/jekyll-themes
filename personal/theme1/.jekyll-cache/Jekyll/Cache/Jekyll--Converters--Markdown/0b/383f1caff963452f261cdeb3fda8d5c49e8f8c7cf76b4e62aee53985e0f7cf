I"Ó<p>Googleâ€™s TensorFlow and Metaâ€™s PyTorch are widely recognized and adopted deep learning frameworks. Both of which are coming from the United States.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a family of next-generation technology that will shape the world as we know it. With speech recognition, businesses can build virtual assistants to serve customers more effectively; with image recognition and autonomous systems, vehicles on the grounds, in the sky and under the sea are becoming intelligent; and with natural language processing, humans can communicate with machines more naturally, etc. All these advancements are brought by AI, and AI is transforming our ways of work and life. AI is more capable than ever before, and we can never say with certainty where its limit should be.</p>

<p>Just like companies in the West, Chinese researchers and companies are also using U.S.-origin technology, software, and commodities to build AI models that will be deployed on their critical systems. As U.S.-China tensions further intensify, strained by a broad array of conflicts, itâ€™s no longer safe to take access to these critical infrastructure for granted. The United States. through the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the Department of Commerce, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) at the Department of the Treasury, has sanctioned dozens Chinese universities, research institutions, and public as well as private sector companies for a variety of reasons from human rights abuses to military modernization efforts â€“ all of which are targeting Chinaâ€™s most promising startups and industry giants.</p>

<p>It is clear â€“ it is clear that the United States sees China no more than a Strategic Competitor, a foreign adversary, and a national security threat. It is also clear that the United States intends to starve Chinaâ€™s businesses and research initiatives with an expansive list of restrictions from securities investment curbs to export control license requirements. Itâ€™s time to act, as I have repeatedly emphasized, to support Made in China with bold action.</p>

<p>Thankfully, with the innovation, hard-work, and patriotism of the Chinese people, weâ€™re not too strained by the United Statesâ€™ edge in cutting-edge technology research. Megvii, a U.S. sanctioned Chinese AI startup, has developed and open sourced its in-house deep learning framework MegEngine. Megvii has advanced into an AI powerhouse with undeniable strengths in image recognition. Alipay and hundreds and thousands of other applications and devices are deploying Megviiâ€™s AI solutions to enable financial transactions, secure critical infrastructure, and much more. Megvii has built MegEngine into an ecosystem with MegStudio that provides free GPU data processing capabilities, AI training courses, and a cloud-based environment for global developers to explore the magic of MegEngine.</p>

<p>Similarly, Baidu, Inc., the worldâ€™s largest Chinese-language search engine has been investing in AI research and development since 2010. It has released its home-made deep learning framework PaddlePaddle for individual and corporate developers to train AI models to meet a wide range of challenges from autonomous driving to counter-desertification efforts. Baiduâ€™s AI Studio is also providing a platform for users to explore Baiduâ€™s AI infrastructure, products, and services, putting AI technology into practice.</p>

<p>Chinese universities, government, and the non-profit sector are also making contributions to the countryâ€™s mission of becoming self-reliant in technology. For instance, the Open AI Foundation, founded by a group of leading universities are providing resources for Chinese and global researchers, businesses, and governments to explore Chinaâ€™s AI offerings. The Ministry of Industry of Information Technology is also recognizing the breakthroughs at Chinese companies. DCloud, OSChina, CSDN, and countless others are also supporting the Chinese developer community by providing code hosting services, editing software, developer forums, funded competitions, open-source data sets, and other mediums for China to thrive in the AI era.</p>

<p>Whilst we must keep an open mind when it comes to research and development in cutting-edge technology, we must put trust in ourselves and do our parts to support our great nation. Chinese universities, companies, and government have done their parts to build an AI future thatâ€™s Made in China. Itâ€™s time for us, the individuals and citizens of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China, to support their efforts with action. As I navigate through career opportunities and my interest in AI, I will check out all these great products, services, commodities, technology, software and equipment from Chinese companies at home and abroad.</p>

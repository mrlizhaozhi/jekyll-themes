I"«<p>Today, Iâ€™m introducing the Internet Security Entity List (ISEL) to safteguard privacy and sensitive personal data online. ISEL is a 
tool for identifying and prohibiting the use of software applications that are deemed harmful to privacy and security.</p>

<p>All software applications added to the ISEL must be immediately deleted from personal devices. Acccess and use of these services
on any device is prohibited.</p>

<p>By creating this entity list, I can secure my privacy and data and warn others the potential risks associated with certain software
applications.</p>

			<h1>Data Analysis with R and Python</h1>
			<p>
				Data is becoming increasingly important. We're producing data every day. By analysing the data that customers produce, companies can provide better, personalised products and services.
				<br><br>
				Data can be quantitative or qualitative, which may include numbers, texts, images, audios, and videos. Whether you run an e-commerce website or a social media application, you need this data as well as the appropriate technologies to get to know your customers and make the most out of your data pipeline.
				<br><br>
				R and Python are popular programming languages for data science. I've learned them both in college. I aspire to become a business intelligence analyst or a data scientist. Therefore, my research includes data analysis with R and Python. I will learn the basics of these tools, use them to analyse and visualise different types of data, and build machine learning models with existing open-source or in-house frameworks and libraries.

			<h1>Relational Databases with SQL</h1>
			<p>
				In order to acquire data from customers, businesses need databases to store and manipulate data.
				<br><br>
				Relational databases are the most common type of database structure. Popular database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server, etc. all use relational models to store data.
				<br><br>
				As data continue to expand and evolve, we need more sophisticated technology to process Big Data. My research includes database systems and the SQL language, which can be used as a Data Definition Language (DDL) and a Data Maniplulation Language (DML).

			<h1>Spreadsheet Modelling with VBA</h1>
			<p>
				Spreadsheets have a long history and will remain relevant despite the emergence of databases due to its ease of use and understanding. Every person who have attended school should have learned spreadsheets in an information technology class.
				<br><br>
				Excel remains the most popular spreadsheet software that companies expect every employee to understand how to use spreadsheets to document information and perform calculations. Financial and data analysts use Excel and VBA to build interactive spreadsheet models to perform repetitive analyses.
				<br><br>
				I'm learning to use Excel and VBA to build interactive data models. These models can be used to assess investment projects at personal and corporate scales.

			<h1>Project Management</h1>
			<p>
				I joined the HSBC Group as a Global Operations Graduate Trainee in July 2021. Project management is one of the required skills for success on this post according to veteran operations managers at the global bank.
				<br><br>
				As I said, my career goals direct my research activities. Therefore, I'm currently studying project management to learn to manage projects cost effectively. I believe this is an important skill for managerial roles at financial institutions and beyond.

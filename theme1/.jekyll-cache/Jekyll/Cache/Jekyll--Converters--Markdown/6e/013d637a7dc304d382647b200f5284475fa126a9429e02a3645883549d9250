I"<p>Yesterday, I received an e-mail from DataCamp, which informed me that the platform has made three courses on SQL, Python and R temporarily free until 12 September 2021. DataCamp is an excellent online resource for learning data science. Perhaps, it’s even better than more popular MOOC platforms such as Coursera.</p>

<p>DataCamp uses a scenario-based, hands-on approach to teach data science concepts and techniques. I believe this’s the most effective way for learning practical subjects such as data analysis.</p>

<p>In the next couple of days, I will plan my schedule carefully to make sure that I fully utilise this period to complete all the three courses that are made free. This’s a great opportunity to learn data science using its platform and evaluate whether I should pay a subscription plan at DataCamp or even consider a full-time master’s
degree in data science back in the United States of America.</p>

<p>As I continue to reflect on my career and plan for the future, I will post my thoughts on my website. I believe this thought process will help many people who may also  have the same puzzle to solve. Please refer to the blog section of my website for these upcoming articles as well as the posts that I’ve already published on this topic.</p>

Career makes up the biggest part of each person's life. We spend the most precious hours of each day at work. We do so to make a living, but a successful career should be much more than that. Our life can be happy only if we build a successful career that works for us. It should be fulfilling, rewarding and growing. This document sets the vision of my career for the next 3 years.

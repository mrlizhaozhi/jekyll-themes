I"£<p>Career and job. These two words are often used interchangeably when people talk about work. Career centres at universities seek to help students secure job offers. But, there is a small but vital difference between these two terms which is unmistakable and must be recognized. I never think these words should be interchangeable under any circumstance. This difference is critical in planning our professional life â€“ careers to which we, as professionals, aspire.</p>

<p>The first question comes to our mind when we graduate from college and start a career should be: What is a job? What does it mean to be unemployed or jobless? And, why is a job so important to us? To what extent it is an imperative?</p>

<p>A belief â€“ a strong belief â€“ in a free and open Capitalist economy is that those who donâ€™t work should not eat. Since early in our childhood, our parents, teachers, and mentors constantly remind us â€“ or in a stronger sense, warn us â€“ of the consequences should we not perform well academically. They say if we donâ€™t do well in class, we wonâ€™t get jobs, we wonâ€™t be able to pay our bills, and we wonâ€™t be living the life we want.</p>

<p>People are paying so much attention to employment but less so about building successful, life-changing careers. When parents and teachers talk about employment, they are mostly referring to job offers. A job is the work we do, either for ourselves or for employers, to get paid so that we can pay our bills, afford our house so that we donâ€™t have to sleep on the streets. This is a broadly accepted definition of the word job which I concur. A job could be a cashier at McDonaldâ€™s front desk or a banker working at computer in Morgan Stanleyâ€™s building on the Wall Street. A job could be any role in society that sends us a paycheck for the work we do so that we can make a living.</p>

<p>The society we live in mandates us having a job. This is true for most of us. Being unemployed means we donâ€™t have the job that pays our bills. We risk living on the streets when we lose our jobs or fail to secure offers in job interviews. Jobs are so important to each and every one of us, but I personally believe that a career is even more important to us, which is a different concept from a job and the next topic that I want to discuss in detail.</p>

<p>To put it simple, a career is different from a job in the sense that it goes far beyond making a living. It weighs much heavier than a paycheck. People donâ€™t build careers just to make a couple thousand bucks but to enrich their lives, broaden their horizons, and elevate their professional standings.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example of a career. Andrew Ng is an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University for Computer Science. Heâ€™s also the founder of Coursera, which is the largest MOOC platform in the world. He also serves as the CEO of three artificial intelligence (AI) companies that he founded - Deep Learning AI, Landing AI, and AI Fund. AI to Andrew is more than a job â€“ he has built it into his career â€“ a career that heâ€™s passionate about. A career that enriches his life and elevates his standing. Countless people watch Andrewâ€™s machine learning courses on Coursera, on YouTube, and through other mediums. People see him as an authority in the field of AI. This is a epitome of what I call a successful career.</p>

<p>You can derive the definition of career from the example above. A career is a professional field of focus about which we are passionate. It goes beyond paying our bills to enrich our lives and lift our standing. When we say a career, we are talking about a field to which we aspire. A field that we are eager to set foot in and make a living of.</p>

<p>I believe we all should look to build careers rather than securing jobs when it comes to professional development. Careers must be looked in a long-term view. It transcends short-term contracts and extend throughout our lifetime. Building a strong career will help us unleash our true potential, realize our value, make high return on investments and enrich our lives, both professionally and personally. This is the pivotal role of the difference between a career and a job that should play in our professional decisions.</p>

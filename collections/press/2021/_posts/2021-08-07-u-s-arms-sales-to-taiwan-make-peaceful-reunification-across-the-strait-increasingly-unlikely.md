On 4th August 2021, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) disclosed that the U.S. Department of State (DoS) had approved arms sales to Taiwan. This's the first time the Biden Administration approves arms sales to the island at the centre of geopolitical disputes between the People's Republic of China (PRC or China) and the United States of America (U.S.A. or United States). 

Since the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) retreated to Taiwan, the disputes across the strait had never stopped. Whether Republicans or Democrats are in charge of the White House, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan has continued to this day. The Chinese Civil War had never ended because no peace resolution had ever come in place. With the 1992 Consensus between the leaders of the Chinese mainland and Taiwan falling apart and U.S. pivoting to the Indo-Pacific region, peaceful reunification between the two is increasingly unlikely.

China has made it absolutely clear that if a peaceful reunification becomes impossible either because Taipei Government's push for independence or foreign influence operations in Taiwan, the Chinese Civil War will ressume in the form of military confrontation. With the tensions between China and the United States intensifying across a wide range of issues, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and coalition against Beijing are unlikely to stop.

It's up to the Chinese people on the mainland and Taiwan to prevent wars from happening again in this region. People are peace-loving in nature. No one wants to see military conflicts next door. However, we want lasting peace but not peace under geopolitical pressure. 

The United States has military buildups around the world. It has military bases in South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. Now it's getting closer and closer to the Chinese claimed island of Taiwan. We the people in the region should advocate for lasting peace. And, we should fight back with resolve when lasting peace becomes increasing unlikely under foreign influence.

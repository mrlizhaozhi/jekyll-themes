I"Ý<p>Today is the last Saturday before I officially join the HSBC Group as a Global Operations Graduate Trainee. This is a milestone in my career. It is my first full-time job after university graduation. I think this is the right time to pause for a moment to reflect on the past and look into the future.</p>

In the past four years, I spent most of my time on the Marquette University campus in Milwaukee, WI where I studied finance and information systems and obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree. The world has been largely changed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing U.S.-China dispute over a wide range of issues. The only certainty has been uncertainty. I couldnâ€™t anticipate where I would end up at even just two months ago. Iâ€™m grateful. Iâ€™m tremendously proud of what Iâ€™ve achieved so far. Iâ€™m grateful for this opportunity to join one of the largest financial institutions in the world as a management trainee. Iâ€™m grateful because not many people have the privilege to work from home, stay with family, and get a decent salary on the first job after graduation. I believe my HSBC experience will be colourful. Itâ€™ll make my resume stand out from my peers and help me open more doors of opportunity.</p>

<p>Now, letâ€™s look at the job itself. HSBCâ€™s Global Operations Graduate Programme is a rotational programme that offers final-year students and recent graduates the opportunity to build an international career and learn about one of the largest financial institutions in the world. The programme will allow me to work in four different business areas within the bank and grow my knowledge base and skills on this journey. This is a unique opportunity that I must capture and utilise wisely.</p>

<p>Before joining the bank, weâ€™ve had a couple of Zoom meetings with the 2020 cohort of the programme and met some senior managers in different business services across Asia, Europe and North America. This is a truly global organisation. From those conversations, I learned more about life at HSBC. Many speakers from the 2020 cohort emphasised the importance of time management. Indeed, this is a very critical skill that everyone should master in order to maximise the value of scarce resources including time.</p>

<p>My first assignment at HSBC is with the Credit Service department at HSBCâ€™s Global Service Centre in Guangzhou, China â€“ my home city. I will join the wholesale credit operations team and help the bank improve its operational efficiency and customer experience. While I donâ€™t know what exactly my responsibility will be at this moment, I can start learning to prepare for my role. Indeed, Iâ€™ve been doing so since day one. I believe itâ€™s critical to keep learning to seize future opportunities and make the most out of each rotation in the programme.</p>

<p>Thisâ€™s a new start. University life is just history now. Nobody knows what the future will be like, neither do I. But I have set a couple of objectives and goals for the next six months with the Credit Service department.</p>

<p>My goal is to learn as much as possible from each rotation. Itâ€™s that simple. I believe simpler, clearer goals are the most effective ones. So, Iâ€™ll just leave my goal in this one sentence â€“ to learn as much as possible from each rotation. Now, below are my objectives. To achieve goals like this, I need to break it down and set some smaller, more specific and manageable goals, aka objectives. Iâ€™ve set three objectives to help me attain this goal.</p>

<p>The first objective is to get to know new and old colleagues and establish connections with them. HSBC is such a huge and globalised organisation that networking has become an imperative. I need to see this and act on it to make sure Iâ€™m well prepared to take on more responsibilities as I advance in my career at the bank. This can be done through either face-to-face conversations or virtual meetings via technology. HSBC has created a rich on-line community to facilitate networking within the company. I must utilise every tool and opportunity available to connect with people, share my experience and learn from these great people.</p>

<p>The second objective is to ask as many questions as possible to get to know my responsibilities and the broader business of HSBC. Asking is the most effective way to demonstrate oneâ€™s enthusiasm and learn new things. Whenever Iâ€™m in doubt, I can consult the two mentors assigned to me, my line manager and colleagues. Thereâ€™s no shortage of support, but itâ€™s all up to me to utilise them. Additionally, as a management trainee, I need to understand the broader business. I must stay at the forefront of everything we do to make the right decisions for the company. I must be open-minded and focus not only on my required tasks but also the needs of the bank. Thisâ€™s not a regular job. Itâ€™s a programme that is designed to produce bank managers of the future. HSBC expects me to be a leader, so I must act like one.</p>

<p>My final objective is to keep learning after work. Itâ€™s important to invest as much time as possible in learning new things not only for the sake of work but also for personal development. My competitors wonâ€™t be turning on the sleep mode whilst weâ€™re not at work. I must stay ahead of them by learning as much as possible. I need to be clear about my short-and-long-term goals and plans all the time.</p>

<p>These three objectives should help me achieve the goal of learning as much as possible from each rotation in the programme. I will review this plan at the end of my first rotation in March 2022. Whilst itâ€™s difficult to stick to a plan, I will be more nimble and agile in adapting new changes with than without a plan.</p>

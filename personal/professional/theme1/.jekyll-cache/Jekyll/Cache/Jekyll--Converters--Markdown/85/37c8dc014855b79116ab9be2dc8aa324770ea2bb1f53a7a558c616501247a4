I"â<p>I must continue to build data science, application development and storytelling through animation capabilities. These are critical skills that will shape my career. Whilst I remain hopeful for a brighter career future, I must take action to create the conditions needed to thrive at both professional and personal levels.</p>

<p>To do this, I need to revisit my childhood and educational background and conduct research on the job market to see where my passions belong, and how I can get from where I am today to where I hope to be at retirement 40 years from now. This is no small, easy task, but I have faith in my ability to chart a course forward to a brighter future built on my own with assistance from a robust alliance system filled with resourceful talents.</p>

<p>Whether it is analytics, applications or animation, I must consider and include them all in my plans and agendas. I must take decisive and bold action to sharpen these skills and broaden my horizon. I must take ownership and responsibility at work, seize every opportunity to learn and grow, chase my dreams, thrive to attain strategic objectives and never give an inch to threats and so-called ‚Äúreality‚Äù shaped by others, including family members.</p>

<p>A life without challenges is a life that doesn‚Äôt worth living. I‚Äôm living to confront threats, tackle challenges, and do what‚Äôs best and most fulfilling to me as an individual ‚Äì a human being. As a mission-oriented, value-driven person, I must live up my own standards, do what it takes to realise ambitious yet attainable goals. Only so doing will I be able to unleash true potentials and fulfil my purpose of living.</p>

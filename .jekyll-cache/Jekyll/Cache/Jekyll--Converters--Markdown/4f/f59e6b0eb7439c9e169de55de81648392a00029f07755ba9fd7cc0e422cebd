	<p>I worked on and completed a number of projects in web development, data science and artificial intelligence at school and after work. I've featured a few of these projects to demonstrate my professional skills and progress. On this page, you will find a list of projects categorised into the aforementioned groups, each with a short description of the project and links to source code and documents.</p>
	<h1>WRITING PROJECTS</h1>
	<h3>Python Essentials for Data Science</h3>
	<p>
		<img src="/assets/images/cover-page.png" style="float: right; width: 200px; height: auto;" />
		I'm writing an introductory Python data science textbook. This book aims at addressing the gap between beginner 
		data scientists' demands and existing books on Python for data science. The book is designed for absolute beginners 
		in programming and data science. It uses practical examples to illustrate how Python can be used in the data science 
		arena, enabling users to apply Python knowledge to meet data challenges straight away. It's accessible on this website 
		via the following link.

	<h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
	<h3>Web Design System</h3>
	<p>
		I announced in a published blog post that I'm working on the development of a web design system for application
		development. This system includes commonly used web components, code for implementing the components, and detailed
		documentation instructing users on how to use the tools that the system provides to build web-based applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		The system is designed to be comprehensive. It will provide resources for building both front-and back-end features.
		The system will be used in the next iteration of this website as well as other web-based application projects. The 
		system has been made available on this website. Click on the link below to access the page:

	<h3>WordPress Theme</h3>
	<p>
		<img style="float: left; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; margin: 10px;" src="/assets/images/wordpress.png" />
		WordPress is a great free and open-source content management system (CMS) for dynamic websites. Many websites -- from
		government, business to personal websites -- run on WordPress. As a web developer, I'm committed to acquiring the skills 
		in WordPress theme development. Knowing WordPress will help me build better web applications for clients.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started this journey at the beginning of February 2022. I've been trying to turn one of my template designs into a 
		fully functional WordPress website. I've made good progress on this initiative. Once I master the basics of WordPress 
		theme development, I will publish this new website.
	</p>

	<h3>Jekyll Theme</h3>
	<p>
		Jekyll is an excellent static site generator that enables developers to build stunning static websites from 
		markdown files. Jekyll uses Ruby and Liquid to create reusable templates, allowing users to focus on the actual
		content and build webpages easily. This tool helps minimise errors from manual handling of HTML code.

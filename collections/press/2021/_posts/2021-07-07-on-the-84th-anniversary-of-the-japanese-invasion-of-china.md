Today marks the 84th anniversary of the Japanese invasion of China. Wars have never left us. There're still chaos in the Middle East and potential military conflicts in the Korean Peninsula, across the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea.
<br><br>
The video above features the Japanese occupasion of Shanghai, China. This is a shameful, humiliating period of time in China's five thousand years of civilisation and the history of mankind. We must never forget the wars that we fought in and continue to reflect on the past.
<br><br>
The goal of memorisation should not be spewing hate on Japan, Germany, or any country that is responsible for those inhumane activities. Rather, we should focus on preventing wars from the future - both cold and hot ones.
<br><br>
While the Second World War is far behind us, countries must continue to engage with each other on the bases of respect and reciprocity. We must find our common grounds to prevent conflicts and nip violence in the bud.

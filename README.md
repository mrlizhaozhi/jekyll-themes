# Jekyll Static Website Themes

I'm using Jekyll to build websites, blogs and portfolios. This repository is created to store my work in Jekyll development. I'm open-sourcing these templates to help developers build their websites faster. 

Please note that some if not all themes use plugins that are not supported by GitHub Pages to build certain functionalities. Please `git clone` your repository and copy the `git` folder and paste it inside the `_site`folder to update the sites locally and push only the `_site` folder with generated HTML webpages to GitHub repositories. 

It is recommended to consult [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com) and [Jekyll Docs](https://www.jekyllrb.com) before approaching me for support. I have not developed custom plugins that have no documentation in these themes.

I"b<p>Today, Iâ€™m removing Twitter and Facebook from the Internet Security Entity List, effective 7 September 2021 at 5:00 PM. These two applications were added to the 
Entity List due to security risks associated with opaque community rules and restrictions imposed on account following.</p>

<p>Following this removal, all restrictions imposed on these software products are lifted. The Internet Security Entity List is a tool for identifying and prohibiting
the use of certain applications that imply security risks.</p>

<p>If any evidence suggesting security risks surface in the future, Twitter and Facebook may be added to the Entity List again.</p>

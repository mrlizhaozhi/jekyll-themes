	The Research Centre at the Office of Li Zhaozhi has a simple yet critical mission: Strengthen technical skills to
	secure opportunities.
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I believe continuous learning is important. It is how I can compete and win. To build a strong and growing career,
	I must understand what knowledge and skills I need and how I can acquire them. The Research Centre offers programmes
	that help achieve these objectives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Research programmes are curated learning curriculum in which I get to identify problems, gather data and resources,
	and conduct research to answer those problems. Each programme is designed to acquire knowledge and skills in a subject.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, the Data Science Programme offers resources to acquire knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics,
	and computing; the Web Application Programme offers resources to acquire knowledge and skills in web-based application
	development; and the Artificial Intelligence Programme offers resources to acquire AI-related knowledge and skills.
&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

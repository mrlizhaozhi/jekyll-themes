I"Ï<p>Today, Iâ€™m excited to announce the official launch of the Python data visualization and web development projects.</p>

<p>Just a few minutes ago, I completed all the eleven chapters in Part I of <i>Python Crash Course</i>. These chapters cover the fundamentals of Python object-oriented programming. Itâ€™s time to apply the knowledge and skills that I just acquired to solve some challenges in data and on the Web.</p>

<p>The same book provides challenges on data visualization and web development. These are much needed skills for my career advancement. Beginning today, I will roll out and follow action plans to complete these projects while continue to acquire Python programming skills.</p>

<p>Python is a high-level general purpose programming language capable of multiple applications. It has libraries such as Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas for data analysis, frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and PaddlePaddle for machine learning and other artificial intelligence applications, and Django and Flask for web application development. I will learn all these useful tools in the two projects.</p>

<p>I will continue to post on this website to share with you my takeways from this adventurous learning journey.</p>

I"ñ<p>As part of the site relaunch campaign, Iâ€™m redesigning the Research and Projects sections of the website to make them more accessible. I will also add more content and reorganise the information on these pages. I expect to relaunch these sections before February 2022.</p>

<p>On the new Research page, you will see a list of research topics with a short description, relevant blog posts and projects. The short description will explain what Iâ€™m researching on and the posts and projects help further the discussions.</p>

<p>On the new Projects page, you will see a list of projects organised into five categories: Web Development, Data Science, Business Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Philosophical Thinking. These projects will come with a description, links to sources and blog posts.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll put out another announcement when these sections return to live. In the meantime, please continue to visit the website. You will learn more about changes like these in the blog section.</p>

I"z	<p>Today, I made two important decisions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delete my Instagram account</li>
  <li>Add Instagram to the Entity List</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I announced earlier to leverage Instagram to share art with audiences around the world and follow artists on the platform, I’ve been unsuccessful in operating a presence on this platform.</p>

<p>As I’m not proficient enough to create quality artwork to share with the world, the channel has been largely empty or filled with unrelated content. At the time of this writing, there’re only 40 followers, including some college friends, sex models, and advertisers, etc. It appears that the operation is not successful, and this is not the best time to keep a presence on Instagram.</p>

<p>I opened the account in hope to share with the world my artwork. I’ve made little progress in making art, and my strategy for the profile remains vague. Even worse, Meta Platforms kept imposing arbitrary restrictions on my IG and FB accounts. Until recently, I’ve been prohibited by the system from following new accounts even though I’ve not violated any rules.</p>

<p>I’m unable to reach Instagram Support like many other users who have complained multiple times on the Internet, so I had no choice but to raise the issue with a post on Instagram. That post was removed by the system, citing violation of community rules because of nudity in the shared image, which was in fact Meta’s own logo.</p>

<p>I believe it’s safe to conclude that at this time maintaining a precense on Instagram doesn’t fit my needs nor serve my best interest. Another reason I opened this account is because I’m afraid that other users would take my favourite handles. Now, I have come to the realisation that handles are not as important as the content. Many celebrities are not using their names on social media as usernames but are still recognisable and successful in running social media campaigns.</p>

<p>In addition to the decision of deleting the Instagram account permanently, I have decided to add Instagram to the Entity List for arbitrary restrictions on accounts that could violate users’ interests and rights. Long before making these decisions, I’ve removed the Art and Design Studio’s web pages from this website. I believe it’s time for me to acquire the skills first. After I can make good art, that would be a better time to run social media precense.</p>

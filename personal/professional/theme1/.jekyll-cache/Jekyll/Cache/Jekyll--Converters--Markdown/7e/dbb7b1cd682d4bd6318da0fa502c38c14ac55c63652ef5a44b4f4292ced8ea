I"‰<p>Iâ€™m designating HBuilderX and its operating company DCloud for potentially harmful bugs in the software.</p>

<p>HBuilderX is an open-source code editor offered by DCloud, a Chinese company. Iâ€™m always willing to support Made in China because it is critical to our nationâ€™s future. Code editors are a critical infrastructure. Much of the modern economy and society run on digital tools built with computer code. HBuilderX offers an alternative to Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text and other programs from Western countries. I downloaded the software to support this Made in China product.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, HBuilderXâ€™s apparent bugs are getting irritating. I have not been able to launch the program on Windows 10 after the initial start up after restart of my computer. This is a big time-consuming issue. A simple search on DCloudâ€™s product forum reveals that this bug is not endemic to my computer â€“ it is shared among HBuilderX users. And, this issue has been around for quite a few years since 2019. We are now approaching the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Whilst the DCloud team has offered some help by listing possible causes of this bug but updates of the software didnâ€™t help resolve this issue. I have never had a similar issue with other software installed on Window 10. This reveals that HBuilderX is the source of the problem, and it needs to be fixed by the developer.</p>

<p>DCloud is responsible for offering products and services that work. It should attempt to address this wide-spread issue from its side rather than pointing users to solve this issue on their own. This bug is annoying and consumes precious time.</p>

<p>Todayâ€™s designations add the software and company to the growing list of entities with concern. The Entity List is a tool that the Office of Li Zhaozhi uses to identify and counter threats from unsafe entities, including commodities, software and people.</p>

<p>The Office will continue to use the Entity List vigorously to secure its critical computer systems and assets by identifying and blocking access to entities reasonably believed to be insecure.</p>

<p>A report has been filed with DCloud to raise this concern.</p>

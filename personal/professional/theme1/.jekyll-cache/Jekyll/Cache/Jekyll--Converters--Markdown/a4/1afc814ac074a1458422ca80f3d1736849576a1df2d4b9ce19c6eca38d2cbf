I"‡<p>Welcome to the Office of Li Zhaozhi official web portal! This site is built with Jekyll and served on GitHub Pages.
It is a static website running without database systems and server-side programs. The websiteâ€™s sole purpose is to
present contents, including texts, images, drawings, videos, etc., to visitors.</p>

<p>As the owner, developer and operator of this website, Iâ€™m responsible for every aspect of this website from web page
design, content publishing to accessibility. I adopted responsive design principles when building this website. You
can access the website from any medium of your choice.</p>

<p>Whilst Iâ€™m committed to making this website accessible to the widest possible audience, Iâ€™m unable to support all media
at this moment. It is recommended that visitors use the latest version of the following browsers to get the optimal
browsing experience:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Google Chrome</li>
	<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
	<li>Apple Saffari</li>
	<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
</ul>

<p>This website uses cutting-edge web technologies such as CSS Grid, which are not supported by legacy and discontinued
web browsers such as Microsoftâ€™s retired Internet Explorer browser series.</p>

<p>As I continue to create new content for the site, I will continue to enhance the websiteâ€™s accessibility features to
help more people get access to the content presented on this website. Please stay tuned!</p>

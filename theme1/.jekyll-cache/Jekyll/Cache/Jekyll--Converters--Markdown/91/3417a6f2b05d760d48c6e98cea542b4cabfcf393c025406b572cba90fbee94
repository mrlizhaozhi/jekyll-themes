I"h<p>Today (30 July 2022), I signed up for an art and design course curated for animation artists at Shuhua Meishu. Shuhua is an acclaimed education service company that specialises in art education. Iâ€™m ecstatic to kick off this wonderous learning journey and move one step forward towards the dream of becoming an animation director.</p>

<p>In this course, I will learn from the basics of drawing to advanced design in character animation. This course comprehensively covers everything I need to be a qualified animation artist. I must put in time and effort to succeed in this paid course. I must seize all resources and opportunities to learn and practise. I must set up an art studio at home to practise drawing whenever I can. This is how I can make progress and become a better artist.</p>

<p>Drawing is fundamental to animation. I need to master drawing and design before moving into animation. This is how it works, so I must concentrate on drawing and storytelling now before moving on to learning animation. I have every confidence in my ability to succeed in the course and realise my ambitions in animation.</p>

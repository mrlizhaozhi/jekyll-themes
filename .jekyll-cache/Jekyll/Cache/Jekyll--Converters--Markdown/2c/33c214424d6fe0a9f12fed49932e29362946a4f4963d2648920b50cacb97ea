I"Í<p>Time is a scarce resource. No one can claim to have enough time if he or she has great ambitions. How effective we can manage our time determines how significant the achievement we can accomplish in our lifetime. Undoubtedly, time management is an essential skill for both work and life.</p>

<h1> "How effective we can manage our time determines how significant the achievement we can accomplish in our lifetime." </h1>

<p>How do we effectively manage our time? From my perspective, time management has four principles. These principles underpin every time management strategy that is considered effective. These principles are 1) leaving no second unused; 2) doing the right thing at the right time, 3) keeping track of progress and 4) learning from the past to prepare for the future. I will go over each of these and design an effective time management strategy that is based on these principles and works for both work and life.</p>

<h2> Principle 1. Leaving no second unused </h2>
<p>In theory, it‚Äôs impossible to ‚Äúunuse‚Äù our time. Whether we work, eat or sleep, time flies by. It never pauses even a second for us to consider what to do. Leaving no second unused, putting it more accurately, is about using up every second available to do meaningful stuff. Meaningful tasks are items planned on our agenda. They usually produce long-term benefits. For example, instead of listening to music for an hour, we‚Äôd better off using this hour on something more meaningful such as learning a programming language or reading a well-written book.</p>

<h2> Principle 2. Doing the right thing at the right time </h2>

<p>There‚Äôre two important concepts in this principle: the right thing and the right time. What is a right thing? A thing, or a task, is considered ‚Äúright‚Äù if 1) it delivers tangible outcomes, 2) fit in the time, and 3) is placed on agenda. Simply put, the right thing is something of importance. What about the right time? A time is considered ‚Äúright‚Äù if 1) it has been carefully planned and allocated, 2) it is measured, and 3) it is spent on something meaningful. In summary, doing the right thing at the right time is about doing what is important during the time allocated to this activity according to plan. To make this happen, we must understand our goals, prioritise these goals, and carefully allocate our available time to each goal based on significance.</p>

<h2> Principle 3. Keeping track of progress </h2>
<p>It‚Äôs proven true that learning from history can help us do better in the future. And the first step is to record history, tracking our performance. This is what this principle is about, very simple. We should know how well we have planned our time and executed this plan.</p>

<h2> Principle 4. Learning from the past to prepare for the future </h2>
<p>As mentioned, learning from the past can help us better prepare for the future. How much we can learn from history is how much we can improve for the future. I must seize every opportunity to learn, to grow, and strive to be at our best in whatever we do. This is how we make progress and become better.</p>

<h1> "How much we can learn from history is how much we can improve for the future." </h1>

<p>As previously discussed, the principles listed shall underpin every strategy that is considered successful, effective at time management. There‚Äôre many techniques and tools can help us design and implement the strategy that delivers. This is what we‚Äôre going to do next after having gained a thorough understanding of the four principles.</p>

<h2> Principles-based strategy </h2>
<p>A principles-based strategy is a strategy embraces the four principles of time management. This time management strategy should leave no second unused (principle 1), demonstrate prioritisation and effective allocation of time (principle 2), provide tools to track progress (principle 3) and include reflection activities (principle 4).</p>

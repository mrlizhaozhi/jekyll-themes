I"¼<p>Today, Iâ€™m designating certain software applications as security risks on the internet. The vendors behind these software applications are maliciously acquiring sensitive user data or arbitrarily restricting certain user activities without giving proper notices or the option to opt out. 
<br /><br />
These software applications include:<br /><br /></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Software developed, controlled, owned, or operated by Baidu (Baidu APPs):
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
	<li>Baidu APP</li>
	<li>Baidu Tieba</li>
	<li>Baidu Zhidao</li>
</ul>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Software developed, controlled, owned, or operated by OSChina (OSChina APPs):
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
	<li>OSChina</li>
	<li>Gitee</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br />
I found Baidu APPs are collecting sensitive data such as location even after disabling their ability to do so at Appleâ€™s privacy setting checkpoints. 
<br /><br />Baidu APPs are also imposing arbitrary restrictions on certain user activities. For instance, when users post anything critical of Baiduâ€™s products on their profiles, the applications would remove those comments without giving any notice. Any politically sensitive comments would also be removed. Companies that do not accept the most genuine feedback from users simply cannot be good by any standard.
<br /><br />
Baidu APPs also have stringent rules that limit usersâ€™ freedoms. For example, the applications do not allow users to change their usernames or require subscription to do so.

<p>CSDN, OSChina, and Gitee are engaged in coersive tactics in account management. I found these applications are deceiving users to create accounts through third-party applications, which are usually social media services. Many users have created accounts on these platforms without knowing it. These applications also lack convenient venues for users to download and delete their data and leave the platforms.
<br /><br />
Additionally, they are as well imposing arbitrary restrictions on user activities. Gitee, for example, has blocked dozens of words and phrases that are deemed politically sensitive. The algorithm that the service use to detect these words and phrases; however, frequently misunderstands usersâ€™ expressions. These restrictions have imposed considerable costs on users.
<br /><br />
Moving forward, I will continue to identify malicious software applications and share them on my website. I urge each of you to establish an Internet Security Entity List to identify and prevent the use of applications that you believe to have endangered your freedom, privacy, and security online.</p>

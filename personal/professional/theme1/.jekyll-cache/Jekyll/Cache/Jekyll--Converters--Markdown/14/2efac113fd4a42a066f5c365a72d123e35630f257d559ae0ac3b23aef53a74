<p>Jekyll offers a lot of plugins for free that enable you to achieve a lot more than the standard Jekyll can.</p>

<p>I had a hard time installing and using these plugins; however, perhaps that is because the official documentation on the Jekyll website isnâ€™t clear enough for newbies like me.</p>

<p>The plugin that I tried to install on my application is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-paginate</code>, which allows you to paginate your static blogs. I find this feature fascinating because it really helps simplying my static blog; otherwise, I really have no idea how you can efficiently manage a static site on which youâ€™re going to publish a growing list of articles.</p>

<p>In the Gemfile that you manually create in your applicationâ€™s root directory, type in the following code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'jekyll', '4.2.1'
group :jekyll_plugins do
	gem 'jekyll-paginate'
end
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Note that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code> at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group :jekyll_plugins do</code> is on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll_plugins</code>â€™s side. This is important. If you type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group: jekyll_plugins do</code>, you will likely get an error! Also it is a underscore mark instead of a hyphen in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll_plugins</code>.</p>

<p>After editing the Gemfile, you should also include in your _config.yml file the following code to intiate the plugins that you just installed:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>plugins:
- jekyll-paginate
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now you should open a command prompt and type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> or simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle</code>.</p>

<p>After all these, you can now serve your site. BE CAREFUL!!! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code> are not the same!!! This part wasted me hours to figure out. Since you installed the plugins with a Gemfile and bundle, you should always use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serv</code> otherwise the plugin that you just installed wonâ€™t be effective in your app!</p>

<p>The Biden Administration appears to be sticking with ex-President Trump’s “Get Tough on China” policy. 
<br /><br />
Since the U.S.-China relations rapidly declined under Trump’s trade war with China, the United States has sanctioned dozens of Chinese entities including Beijing, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong SAR government officials, P.R.C. government administrative bureaus, private companies, and state-run organizations. 
<br /><br />
While the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China (MFA China) mentioned the possibility of establishing what it calls an “Unreliable Entities List” in response to U.S. sanctions, the Chinese government hasn’t made much visible progress on this pending regulation.
<br /><br />
It’s a good sign though that China passed the <i>Anti-Sanctions Law</i> in June 2021, but an Entity List, or even Entity Lists, is needed to secure China’s foreign policy and national security interests as well as the legally granted interests and rights of its private sector enterprises.
<br /><br />
While the U.S. frequently cites human rights and national security concerns when placing curbs on Chinese entities, the targets are mostly China’s national champions in technology. Taking into account the bills that the United States recently passed to designate the People’s Republic of China as a “strategic competitor” and push for competition with the Asian civilization, U.S. sanctions are undermining the interests of China’s foreign policy, national security, and economy. They’re merely targeting rights abusers but the tools that the U.S. utilizes to surpress China’s growing power. 
<br /><br />
China needs entity lists to target malign actors that seek to undermine its interests. This should include both domestic (e.g. Apple Daily) and foreign (e.g. H&amp;M) entities. This’s the most effective way to demonstrate China’s resolve to confront foreign aggression and its ability to retaliate against the United States and others. Imposing costs on entities that are engaged in, or represent the risk of becoming engaged in, destablizing activities is absolutely necessary to saftguard China’s interests.
<br /><br />
China should not worry about foreign companies’ sentiment towards China. China must make it clear that friendly investors are more than welcomed, but malign actors are not welcomed on Chinese soil. We must always put national interests first. This is the redline that no one, not even the most generous investors, should be allowed to pass.

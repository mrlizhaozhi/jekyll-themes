			Building a rewarding, adventurous career across sectors and borders.

				A successful career should be rewarding in both financial and intellectual terms. It should provide 
				exposure to various opportunities to connect, learn and grow. I'm looking to use analytics and technology
				to create value for the organisation, consumers, and economies that I work for.

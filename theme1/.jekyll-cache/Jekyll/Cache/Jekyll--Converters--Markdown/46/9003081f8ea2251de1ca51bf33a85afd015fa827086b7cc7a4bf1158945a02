I"ý<p>On 26 July 2021, I joined the HSBC Group as a Graduate Trainee in Guangzhou, China. Thisâ€™s my first full-time job after graduation. Iâ€™ve been writing about this job long before joining this global financial institution. Yesterday, 30 July 2021, I concluded my first week as an HSBC employee. Now, Iâ€™d like to share my first impression of the bank as a Chinese-based new joiner.
<br /><br />
I can tell HSBC is investing heavily in management trainees like me. The Guangzhou branch welcomed five trainees in total this year. HSBC has three office buildings in Guangzhou â€“ my home city. I joined the group from its Taikoo Hui office. Taikoo Hui is a mix-used property located at the heart of downtown Guangzhou. Iâ€™m privileged to have this opportunity to join the bank as a graduate trainee. 
<br /><br />
Since the HSBC building is connected to a metro station, I spend ninety minutes taking underground to work every morning. The metro station is located at the lobby of the building, thus itâ€™s very convenient to commute via underground trains. We didnâ€™t do much on the first day of work. We arrived at the lobby at 9 AM in the morning, filled out some forms and one of the human resource managers led us to the IT helpdesk to get our laptops ready. We also toured our offices and met with the line managers who will be responsible for our first rotation in the programme. We had daily meetings after work with trainees from other countries such as India, Mexico, Poland, and the United Kingdom. HSBC sets a very high standard for every trainee the company recruits from top universities around the world. It expects us to be the bankâ€™s future leaders. 
<br /><br />
The organisation is far larger than I thought. The entire 17-storey building belongs to the bank. The organisation also owns properties across the Greater China Region and the globe. HSBC assigns employees into hierarchical bands. Management trainees are Level 6 employees, which are equivalent to department managers. The company provides trainings to all new joiners in various formats including MOOC and meetings.
<br /><br />
Since our business is global, we need to co-operate with colleagues from across the world. I had to meet with colleagues working from different time zones. The ability to work on a flexible schedule is critical at HSBC. Iâ€™m overwhelmed because Iâ€™ve never worked at an organisation with such a large scale, and I get to manage employees whoâ€™re more experienced than me as a business manager. Many of my co-workers have years of experience in banking and masterâ€™s degrees from prestigious universities.
<br /><br />
I left with my first assignment which will be due in two weeks. Next week, I will participate in the global graduate induction via Zoom in which I will meet with trainees from other countries and the Group Chief Executive Mr Noel Quinn. Iâ€™m both excited and nervous about these events. In the coming weeks, I will focus on learning the business, acquiring knowledge and skills and successfully delivering my first project.</p>

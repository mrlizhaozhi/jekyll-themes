Today, the United States sanctioned dozens of Chinese and Hong Kong SAR government officials over the National Security Law passed and implemented in 2020. It also issued a business advisory to warn companies about the associated risks of doing business in the Chinese territory under the law. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, like many U.S. officials including President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. highlighted the arrests at Apple Daily and its subsequent closure.

Before talking about the National Security Law, we should understand why it was implemented last year, not before. In 2019, a Hong Kong couple visited Taiwan, China. The husband murdered his wife and fled back to Hong Kong. Since there is no extradition treaty between Hong Kong and other areas of China, which is ridiculous considering the fact that Hong Kong had extradition treaty with many foreign countries including the United States, the Hong Kong and Chinese officials believed that an extradition bill is needed to protect the interests and rights of the people and bring criminals to justice. This proposed, never passed extradition bill triggered waves of debates, demonstrations, and later vandalism in the international city.

Many corrupted government officials and criminals are hiding in Hong Kong. Hong Kong provided a shield for those who seek to undermine the interests of the public. Western countries such as the United States and United Kingdom are actively engaged in colour revolution in the Chinese city. The proposed extradition bill exposed many of these individuals and organisations. Many local and foreign companies in the city were adversely impacted by the civil unrests. For example, Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's flagship carrier reported significant declines in inbound and outbound passenger numbers long before COVID-19 hit the city. The airline made it clear that those declines were attributable to the protests. Almost all major companies operating in Hong Kong later issued statements to call on the return of the rule of law and protection of their properties from the violent protestors. The National Security Law did just that.

The United States seems to be very concerned about the "deteriorating" situation in Hong Kong. The fact is that there have been more U.S. companies and travellers in Mainland China than Hong Kong for many years. If the United States isn't concerned about the situation in the remainder of China, why would it focus on Hong Kong's situation other than geopolitical ambitions in the region considering the country has designated the People's Republic of China as a strategic competitor?
<br><br>
Responsible Chinese citizens from both the mainland and Hong Kong should think carefully about the unspoken facts about these U.S. actions. Hong Kong remains a highly-ranked financial centre for international trade. Last year, dozens of technology companies went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The National Security Law didn't hold companies back from seeking the benefits that Hong Kong provides. With the growing Chinese market, Hong Kong will remain as an important hub for international investment.

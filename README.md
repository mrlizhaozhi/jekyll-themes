# Jekyll Static Website Themes - Powered by Netlify CMS!

I'm using Jekyll to build static websites that serve various purposes. This repository stores all my work in Jekyll development. I'm open-sourcing these themes to help developers build websites faster. 

Please note that these themes use plugins that are not supported by GitHub Pages for certain functions, so `git clone` your repository and copy the `git` folder and paste it inside the `_site` folder of the themes to edit the sites locally and push only the `_site` folder with generated HTML pages to your GitHub Pages repository. Of course, Jekyll can be deployed on other servers as well.

These themes use the Netlify CMS, enabling easy editing of content. Even you're unfamiliar with web development, git version control and all that technical stuff, you will still find it comfortable using these themes.

It is recommended to consult [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com) and [Jekyll Docs](https://www.jekyllrb.com) before approaching me for support. I have not developed custom plugins that have no documentation in these themes.

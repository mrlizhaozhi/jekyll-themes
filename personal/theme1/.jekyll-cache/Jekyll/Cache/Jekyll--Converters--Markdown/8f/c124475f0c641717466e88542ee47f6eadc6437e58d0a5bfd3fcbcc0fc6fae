I"/<p>Following the decision I made earlier on making web development a lifetime passion, I’m now beginning the learning of designing, constructing and publishing dynamic websites and web-based applications.</p>

<p>I’ve accumulated some experience in building and maintaining static websites like this one. Now, it’s time to take further steps to acquire the knowledge, skills and tools needed to build dynamic, feature-rich Web sites and applications. Dynamic sites and apps are different from static websites and apps in a number of ways. They have more complex structures, require deeper understanding of web technologies, and they are powered by database and content management systems.</p>

<p>WordPress is a popular content management system for dynamic websites and blogs. It runs on PHP, a back-end language that I learned in school. WordPress is widely used across industries from government, businesses, media to non-profits. Some high-profile websites that run on WordPress include the United States Department of State, the White House, Mozilla and the Time Magazine, etc.</p>

<p>WordPress is perhaps the best place to get started. It has pre-designed templates, a rich library of plugins, and a vibrant global developer community. Therefore, I’ve decided to learn to design and create my very first WordPress site in the next couple of days. I will start by editing the default template to publish content, change the appearance and to add plugins. Then, I will move on to integrate my own templates, converting them into WordPress sites just as I did when I integrated Jekyll into my designs for static websites like this one.</p>

<p>I believe this learning journey would be fruitful, and I will share my takeaways and experience in this blog. So, please keep in touch and continue to follow my website and blog!</p>

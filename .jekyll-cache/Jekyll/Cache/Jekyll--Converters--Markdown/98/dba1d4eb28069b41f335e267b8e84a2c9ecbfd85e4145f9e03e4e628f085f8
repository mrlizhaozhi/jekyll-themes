<p>Iâ€™ve been learning web development for two years since I took my very first web development course in junior year at college. Reflecting on this enjoyable and fruitable adventure, Iâ€™ve truly learned a lot and fallen in love with the Web.</p>

<p>In the web development course, I followed one of my favourite professors Dr. Terence T. Ow to learn the basics of web development. That was the first time I meet HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP - the four languages widely used in web development. We learned to build static as well as dynamic web apps. Most of our efforts were concentrated on building functionalities such as login and logout, search tool and pagination, etc. We didnâ€™t spend much time designing accessible webpages.</p>

<p>Following the semester, I took part in a web project during the summer of 2020. That was the first time Iâ€™m in charge of a full-scale commercial web development project. As the tech lead and project manager, I designed, developed and planned the entire project. I integrated almost everything I learned from the web development class and took extra miles to learn functionalities that were not covered in class such as sending out system emails and managing email subscriptions. I also met Bootstrap on that project. That was the first time I learned about the concept of responsive web design.</p>

<p>After graduating from Marquette University, I decided to shore up my development skills. I designed a few more static sites with Bootstrap then I decided to challenge myself to design responsive sites on my own. I did it and succeeded. The remaining problem was campatibility. Whilst I managed to design a visually compelling website, it was not compatible with IE 11. So that was my next step. I again took the extra miles, searched online, and that is how I designed the current website youâ€™re seeing now. Of course, I designed a few other successful website templates as well.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2022, I learned about Jekyll, the most popular static site generator. This is yet another improvement to my static websites. Jekyll allows me to maintain my website easily. Itâ€™s a great to have feature for developers who want to manage static websites. And, wah lah! Here you go my latest website.</p>

<p>Now, itâ€™s time to push even further. Having now mastered the basics of responsive web design, itâ€™s time to add icing on the cake - add animation and other features to my websites. Itâ€™s also time to learn WordPress development. WordPress is a good place to start learning dynamic web development. It has been a while since the last time I designed and built a fully functional dynamic web app. Itâ€™s time to refresh the skills and learn more about it. This is exactly what Iâ€™m going to do next.</p>

<p>Following the previous announcements on making web development a lifetime passion and learning to design, construct and publish dynamic websites and web-based applications with WordPress, I must manage my time and resources well so that I have ample time to acquire these fascinating knowledge, tools and skills. To record my progress, I will update you my learning journey in this blog. You will see more about web programming here!</p>

I"%<p>The United States of America (“U.S.”, “USA” or “United States”) continues to escalate confrontation with the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”).</p>

<p>On October 5, 2022, during the PRC’s 73rd National Day holiday, the U.S. Department of Defense added 13 state-owned and civilian Chinese companies to its Chinese Military List. This List could result in designated entities being sanctioned by the United States government.</p>

<p>On October 8, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) at the U.S. Department of Commerce added 31 entities to the Unverified List (“UVL”) and made it clear that in 60 days following the addition, the BIS reserves the right to add these entities to the more restrictive Entity List which denies entities access to critical and sensitive U.S.-origin items and technology.</p>

<p>In a press release from the BIS, it reveals that as of October 2022, more than 600 PRC-based entities have been added to the Entity List, subjecting them to strict export controls under the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”).</p>

<p>Since former President Donald J. Trump took office, the United States has been seeing China as a strategic competitor and imposed measures against the PRC on multiple fronts, including in the economic space. These measures target not just the Chinese Communist Party (“CCP”) and its dominated Chinese government, but also civilians and civilian companies.</p>

<p>Computing technology has been the focus of the Biden Administration which continues to adopt measures against China in this field, leveraging its edge in research and development and global alliances.</p>

<p>To secure Chinese interests in the face of U.S. aggression, the People’s Republic of China needs a whole-of-nation strategy which encourages close alignment and cooperation between the state and industry to mitigate risks in supply chain and deter threats to national and economic security.</p>

<p>It’s clear that the United States will continue to target Chinese industries. All people across the government and industry in the PRC should remain vigalent of the risk of overreliance on U.S. technology. PRC persons should review their supply chains to identify U.S.-origin items and replace them with domestic alternatives or safer ones where appropriate. They shouldn’t dream of getting removed from U.S. sanctions programmes. Rather, all Chinese governemnt agencies, research institutions, universities and corporates must invest heavily in talent acquisition, innovation, research and development. This is the single and only viable option to make breakthroughs and circumvent U.S. sanction implications.</p>

<p>I have confidence and faith in Corporate China and the Chinese people when we come together as a nation, we are able to overcome challenges. We must continue our work to realise our vision of a prosperous China suited to lead the world but take action to confront challenges. We must look in the long run, act on facts not emotions, and vigorously defend our interests, values and security.</p>

I"²<p>In less than three hours, I will be joining an interview session with Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G)â€™s information technology department. This will determine whether or not I can secure an offer from this world-renowned fast moving consumer goods company.</p>

<p>This will also mark a career transition - a transition that brings me more aligned with the direction of a STEM career. If I make it through this round of interview, I will become an IT manager at the worldâ€™s largest FMCG company.</p>

<p>For this interview, Iâ€™ve been preparing for one week. This week, I polished my resume, sketched a few mind maps, and created some review documents to thoroughly review my experiences and professional knowledge and skills. I believe this preparation and my passions for STEM and FMCG will pay off in this interview.</p>

<p>I will make another post when I get back from P&amp;G after todayâ€™s intervew. Stay tunned for good news!</p>

Today marks the 76th anniversary of the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. For years, Japanese invaders bombed Chinese cities, stole wealth and resources from the Chinese homeland and relentlessly murdered countless civilians across China and the Asia-Pacific region. 
<br><br>
The world is still waiting for Japan's sincere apology over its inhumane practices. Whilst the World War II is fading away, we the peace-loving Chinese people must remain cautious about potential military conflicts in East and South China seas, the Taiwan Strait and the Himalaya border with India. The increasingly aggressive United States of America and its traditional and emerging partners and allies are posing legitimate national security and military threats to our beloved motherland. Our familities live here, we must do whatever it takes to defend against foreign aggression.
<br><br>
We need both pride and humility when looking at China's 5,000 years of civilisation. This's what we're most proud of as a people. We can learn a lot from history and become better in the future. It's clear that the Japanese didn't surrend because of China's military strength but the nuclear bomb that the United States launched to retaliate Japanese attack on the Perl Harbor. 
<br><br>
As we identify and confront emerging threats in the region, we need to revitalise our economy from the impact of COVID-19, reform our somewhat rigid education system, mordernise our nuclear and military capabilities and start actively engage in international affairs from the perspectives of national interests and security. We need a diplomatic strategy that puts China first and measure by quality instead of purely quantity.

Lithuania has made a huge mistake to allow the Taipei government to open a what it calls "Taiwan Office" in its territories. This's clearly against the One China Policy that the country agreed to uphold when it established ties with Beijing. This act has seriously eroded the foundation based on which the China-Lithuania Relationship is founded upon and China's national interests and security. It's time to end diplomatic ties with a few Western countries under the guidance of the United States to demonstrate China's resolve to confront foreign aggression.

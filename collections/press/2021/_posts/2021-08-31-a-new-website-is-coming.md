<p>
I will launch a new website tomorrow on 1 September 2021. The new website will be accessible at https://mrlizhaozhi.github.io/. The current website will be archived
after the launch. 
<br><br>
I'm doing this to enhance the accessibility of the website. The current website is not compatible in legacy browsers that are still in use such as Microsoft's Internet
Explorer 11 and older versions. The newly created website will address this compatibility issue.
<br><br>
Since GitHub Pages only support static HTML sites, the new website is designed to fit the nature of static websites, making it easy for maintenance, content creation 
and navigation.
<br><br>
I invite you to check out this new browsing experience tomorrow after 9 AM. You may send me any feedback at lizhaozhi2017@163.com.

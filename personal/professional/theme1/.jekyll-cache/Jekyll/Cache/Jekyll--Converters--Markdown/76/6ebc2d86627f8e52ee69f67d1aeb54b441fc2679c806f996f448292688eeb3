I"³<p>The local health authorities reached out to me this afternoon, mandating COVID-19 testing due to possible contact with several patients at the Taikoo Hui shopping mall.</p>

<p>HSBCâ€™s Guangzhou centre is part of the Taikoo Hui complex. I usually have lunch at one of the food court inside the shopping mall. The Chinese governmentâ€™s COVID-19 system monitors the health condition of residents and tracks their movements. It has been identified and reported that at least three COVID-19 patients visited Taikoo Hui. During the same time, I was having lunch at the lower level. As a result, the entire complex has been designated as a restricted area and all persons who have been there on the same day are required to get COVID-19 tests at the nearest test sites at their locations.</p>

<p>China introduced health code to monitor citizensâ€™ health status. It has three colours - green, yellow and red. Each colour represents a status. Green means healthy, yellow indicates potential risks, and red means infected. My health code was switched from green to yellow by authorities after that call.</p>

<p>In the next couple of days, I will fully comply with the rules and measures governing public health. China is one of the few countries with a considerable population that successfully contained this wide-spread virus with decisive response to contain the virus from the government, supported by an informed citizenry and rooted in science and technology.</p>

<p>All Chinese nationals and foreigners whoâ€™re currently residing in China should comply with the law and follow health authoritiesâ€™ guidance to help contain the virus. This is a patriotic duty and an act of responsible global citizens.</p>

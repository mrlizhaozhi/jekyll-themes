I"K<p>Today, I’m permanently deleting my accounts on CSDN, OSChina and Douban. These accounts were not in use for a long period of time and present
potential risks with regard to privacy and data security. 
<br /><br />
Cyber criminals and malicious actors may exploit the information I post through these accounts to target my wallet, my friends and even my 
family. This type of risk is simply unacceptable. 
<br /><br />
By closing the accounts that I don’t use frequently, I’m protecting my security and people who I care through depriving malicious individuals 
and organisations of access to critical information	that can be used to harm my interests and security.
<br /><br />
I encourage all of you to do the same: get rid of the platforms that you don’t need as soon as possible before your data is sold in the dark 
market.</p>

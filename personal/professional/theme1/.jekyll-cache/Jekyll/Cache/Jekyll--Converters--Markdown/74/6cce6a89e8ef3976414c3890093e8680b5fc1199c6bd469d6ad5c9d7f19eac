I"¶<p>Tomorrow, 1st October 2022, marks the 73rd anniversary of the founding of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. The PRC over the past several decades has developed into a strong, world-class economy and increasingly a technology innovation hub for the world.</p>

<p>Our nation has been facing multiple challenges around the world â€“ the U.S.-led Westâ€™s hostility to our growth and acquisition of world leadership, Taiwanâ€™s resistence to reunification and its cozzy relationship with Washington D.C., and aggressive neighbours in different degrees backed by the United States in our disputed waters, etc. We must come together as a nation to deter threats and confront challengers with strength, unity and resilience.</p>

<p>It is true that our nation still has so much work to do. Weâ€™re imperfect, but we canâ€™t allow those who seek to undermine our nationâ€™s vital interests and security by exaggerating our weaknesses and diminishing our accomplishments and contribution to the world.</p>

<p>This civilizationâ€™s 5,000 years of history has proved that we are able to overcome challenges when we unite as a nation. We have had more exposure to challenges than other countries on this planet thanks to this extrodinary history filled with ups and downs. The PRCâ€™s best day has yet to come.</p>

<p>As we continue to do our parts to make this nation stronger and more prosperous than ever before, we should join the patriots and friends of the PRC all around the world in celebrating the National Day in 2022.</p>

<p>We should look back at our history with humility to learn from the past to better prepare for a brighter future to come. This National Day, Iâ€™m visiting my relatives in Guilin, Guangxi. I look forward to this family reunion trip.</p>

<p>I invite all of you to share your words of hope and gratefulness to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. Letâ€™s do our part as citizens to celebrate the birth of this great and wonderful civilization!</p>

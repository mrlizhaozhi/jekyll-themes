I"É<p>Disqus is a great tool for building online communities. It enables audience to engage in global conversations across the Web with a single account. This service is useful for both commercial and non-commercial websites, particularly useful for static sites that do not have databases and server-side programs - the backbones of many useful features.</p>

<p>The problem is that anyone can sign up for an account on Disqus and leave comments on websites that utilise Disqus plugins. Consequently, Disqus isnâ€™t immune to spams and other toxic content. Whilst it is not an integral part of this website, it is still impacting the quality of this website. Therefore, a comment policy must be crafted to regulate comments so that spammers cannot exploit this feature to leave whatever they want on this website. This comment policy is designed to folster a healthy environment for user engagement. It will be included as part of the broader terms and conditions.</p>

<p>As the developer, operator and owner of this website, I have every right to design and implement my own comment policy. My policy is simple as this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All visitors, with or without a Disqus account, are qualified to comment on this website.</li>
  <li>All comments should be relevant to post content. That is, the comments should be rooted in the blog posts.</li>
  <li>All spams, including advertisements, sex invitation and others that are considered irrelevant to the content on this website, are prohibited.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the authority vested in me as the developer, operator and owner of this website, I reserve the right of removing spams as defined above without notifying the authors of the comments.</p>

<p>These rules shall take effect immediately and be added to the terms and conditions of this website. All visitors are responsible for reading and complying with these new rules. If you disagree with any or all items listed in this comment policy, you may not comment on this website.</p>

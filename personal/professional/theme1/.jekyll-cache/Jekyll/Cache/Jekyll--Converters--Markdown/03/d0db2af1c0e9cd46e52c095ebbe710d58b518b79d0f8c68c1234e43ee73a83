I"Æ<p>Continuous learning is critical to long-term career success. To succeed in careers, we must keep an open mind to acquire the knowledge and skills critical to our career development. This knowledge and skills should be relevant to what we do and what we aspire to.</p>

<p>Today, Iâ€™m releasing the first List of Critical Skills for Career Development. This list includes all knowledge and skills for me to succeed in my career. Web development, data science and artificial intelligence are my career interests. These are technical, quantitative fields that require a firm grasp of scientific theories as well as the latest technology for implementing solutions. Moving forward, this List will serve as my guideline for career preparation.</p>

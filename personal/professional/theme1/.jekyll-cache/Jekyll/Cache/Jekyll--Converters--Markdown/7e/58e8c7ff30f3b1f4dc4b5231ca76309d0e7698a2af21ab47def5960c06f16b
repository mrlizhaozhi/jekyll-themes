I"0<p>Today, I re-launched the Li Notes blogs. These blogs are available on this website at <a href="/en-uk/press-office/blogs-opeds/">here</a>. Li Notes was shut down for maintenance. After weeks, it is back online with fresh content.</p>

<p>Li Notes is an important platform for sharing my thoughts, stories and useful resources. Moving forward, I intend to keep this blog live by making new posts every other days. Please stay tunned for interesting content and check out the blogs section regularly for updates.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m considering writing posts on research programmes such as data science, artificial intelligence and web development as well as on other topics such as product management, business development and philosophical thinking, etc. I hope you can find something useful from these blog posts.</p>

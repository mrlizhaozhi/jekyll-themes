As mentioned in the <a href="https://mrlizhaozhi.github.io/blogs/2021-07/growth-plan-before-26-july-2021/">Growth Plan Before 26 July 2021</a>, I'll learn Excel and Project Management to prepare for my job at HSBC. Now, I'd like to share my study plan for this mission.
<br><br>
Professors at universities would hand out course syllabi on the first day of class. I believe in the importance of syllabi. They lay out neatly how courses are structured, what expectations are for students, and how students should be assessed at the end of the courses.
<br><br>
Therefore, I'm going to design a course syllabus to aid my learning of Excel and project management. I think a syllabus is needed because it helps me to stay organized and make sure I complete learning before my first day at HSBC.
<br><br>
I've learned Excel in school. I will focus on the tough parts which are PivotTable, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and perhaps, VBA. The speakers on our Wednesday meeting highlighted these features in Excel, which are very handy on the job as an operations manager at HSBC.
<br><br>
I'll find tutorials - either in video or written format - and download some data sets from Kaggle to practise the use of these Excel features. I believe the best way to learn Excel is to get data and practise with them.
<br><br>
For project management, I'll focus on the principles, models, and tools. Since I've not learned PM systematically before, I will need to take some time to learn this material. I've found two books and a piece of software tool. The two books are Project Management: Achieving Competitive Advantage by Jeffrey K. Pinto and Microsoft Project 2019 Step by Step written by Cindy Lewis, etc. The software is, as you might have guessed it right, Microsoft Project. These books and software are used at Marquette University to teach the project management course for information systems students. I believe I should try these out to learn PM as well.

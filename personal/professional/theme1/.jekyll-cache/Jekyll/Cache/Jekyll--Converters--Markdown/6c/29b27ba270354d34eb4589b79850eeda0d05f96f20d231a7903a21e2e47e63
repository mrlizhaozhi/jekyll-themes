<p>Today (9 October 2022), the Free and Open Internet (â€œFOIâ€) campaign launched a Chinese-language website to educate the people of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (â€œPRCâ€) the importance of keeping the Internet free and open.</p>

<p>In addition to providing knowledge articles, the FOI website also offers solutions to secure a free and open Internet from the hands of authorities that unjustly impose restrictions on information and expression freedoms on the Internet.</p>

<p>The Office of Li Zhaozhi <a href="/office-of-li-zhaozhi-launches-free-and-open-internet-programme-to-counter-unjustified-politically-driven-government-censorship/">launched the Free and Open Internet Intiative</a> to counter threats to Internet freedoms and keep the Internet neutral.</p>

<p>In the coming days, the FOI will post more to its website to include more thought-provoking knowledge articles as well as tools for connecting to the FOI thatâ€™s prohibited by the Chinese Communist Party-led Chinese government of the PRC.</p>

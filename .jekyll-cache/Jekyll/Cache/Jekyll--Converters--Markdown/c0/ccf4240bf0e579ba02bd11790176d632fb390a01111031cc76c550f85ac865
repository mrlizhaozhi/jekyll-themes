Foundations of Artificial Intelligence Learning Plan
</h3>

<h4>
Background
</h4>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrating into our workspace and life. This technology will lead the revolution across hundreds and thousands of sectors, enabling the progression of human society. From academia to industry, AI has become a trending word. Scientists and engineers continuously develop new AI technologies. These technologies have brought far-reaching impact to multiple fields from transport, agriculture, healthcare, to manufacturing.</p>

<p>Autonomous driving and intelligent transport are enabling more people to get on the roads whilst easing traffic congestion. Drones carrying image recognition and intelligent navigation technologies make seeding and harvesting easier. AI can also be used to analyse viruses to design effective vaccines, assure product quality, and automate production lines.</p>

<p>One after another, cases have illustrated the bright prospects of AI. The mastering of AI fundamentals and applications has emerged into a core competency.</p>

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<p>The overarching purpose of this course is to introduce AI, including commonly used technologies and applications. We will learn through a series of cases, engaging in a range of activities such as reading, watching, analyses, and exercises to grasp AI from multiple angles. We will leverage the free resources offered on the PaddlePaddle AI Studio platform to learn the basics of AI and utilize the Chinese-made deep learning framework PaddlePaddle to train simple AI models. We will also use other resources to systematically learn AI.</p>

<p>In addition to domestic deep learning frameworks such as Baidu‚Äôs PaddlePaddle and Megvii‚Äôs MegEngine, there‚Äôre Google‚Äôs TensorFlow and Meta‚Äôs PyTorch. The research and development of AI have become an area of fierce competition between China and the United States. As we support Chinese technology, we must also keep an open mind to learn foreign technology. Due to time constraints, this course will only cover Baidu‚Äôs PaddlePaddle.</p>

<p>Students who participate in this course are expected to have a grasp of Python programming.</p>

<h4>
Resources
</h4>
<p>This course will use a variety of resources to learn AI basics and applications.</p>

<p>Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Business, Education, and Healthcare is the textbook of this course. This book introduces AI use cases in business, education, and healthcare in detail.</p>

<p>Moreover, we will also use the courses and developer resources offered on the PaddlePaddle AI Studio platform as well as video tutorials on PaddlePaddle‚Äôs Bilibili channel. Other resources that will be utilized include forums, blogs, articles, and publications on the internet.</p>

<p>In addition, Baidu Apollo Intelligence Transport White Paper, Intelligent Revolution, and AI Transformation Playbook by AI scholar Andrew Ng are the companion reading materials of this course.</p>

<h4>
Assignments
</h4>
<p>AI is an applied technology, which requires the combination of theories and practice to firmly grasp the fundamentals. Thus, this course has a set of companion learning activities to help students understand AI basics. These activities include reading, watching, analyses, and exercises. Students must complete these activities within a limited amount of time using the knowledge they acquired and available resources.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Writing: There will be 10 writing assignments in this course. Students are tasked to compose articles on given topics, discussing a range of AI applications in industries.
</li>
<br /><br />
<li>
Reading: There will be reading assignments tasking students to integrate their own thoughts and compose short reports. This course includes 5 such reports.
</li>
<br /><br />
<li>
Programming: Students will participate in PaddlePaddle AI Studio courses and complete some programming exercises that review the basics of Python programming and train simple AI models with Paddle.
</li>
</ol>
<p>All the articles and reports will be published on the Artificial Intelligence Blog on the personal website, and all the programming exercises will be published on Gitee.</p>

I".<p>Statistics is at the heart of data science. Business analysts and data scientists use statistics to explore data sets, draw conclusion from samples to reflect populations, and transform raw data into actionable insights. To succeed as a business analyst or a data scientist, I must grasp the fundamentals of statistics before diving into R and Python programming.
<br /><br />
As mentioned in a previous post, I’m using <i>Practical Statistics for Data Scientists 50 Essential Concepts Using R and Python</i> to study R and Python applications in statistics and data science. However, I realised that this book does not fully cover every statistical concept like a traditional textbook. Therefore, I’m looking for a statistics textbook to aid my studies.
<br /><br />
Marin Stats Lectures (https://statslectures.com) is a great resource for learning statistics and R. However, I think a textbook will allow me to learn and review statistical concepts systematically. I believe it’s crucial to learn stuff in a systematic manner.

In college, I learned statistics for business and economics using a textbook with the same name. I plan to revisit this book to fill the gaps in statistics. I will also look for additional resources online to help me practise the application of statistics.

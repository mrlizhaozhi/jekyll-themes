<p>Two months ago, on the 10th of February, I announced the decision to build a design system for web-based application development. Subsequently on 23 February and 3 March, I revealed progress on this project. I’m taking this design system seriously because my passion for the web and coding is real. To excel in this field, I urgently need to acquire the fundamentals, the ability to build out a fully functional, responsive, and accessible web application from scratch. There’s no better way to do just that by building a design system from the ground up.</p>

<p>However, since the 3 March release, I’ve not been making much progress on the design system. I’ve been doing research on Django, WordPress and other web development frameworks and moved away from front-end design. The need for this design system to function as soon as possible arose recently when I attempted to modernize my website. It’s time to pick up from where I left off and roll out an action plan to build out this much needed system for application development.</p>

<p>Today, I will revisit the documentation for the design system to add more details. These details will then be turned into tangible steps to construct the system. I will learn to use HBuilderX and MasterGo, two Made in China software tools, as I develop this system. Everything great starts small. It’s time now to take the first step towards the release of the design system. The delivery of this system will determine when and how well I will be able to relaunch the current website.</p>

<p>There’re many areas of improvement on the website you’re looking at. For instance, the blogs are only accessible from the Blogs page. The search feature doesn’t support the Chinese language yet, and the website doesn’t have a Chinese-language edition, etc. All these modernization efforts will require the use of a sophisticated design system.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to rebuild this website using a template I designed last year. Unlike the current theme which is built with CSS Flex, the theme I’m planning to use was made with CSS Grid. Just like the current website, it doesn’t use a design system. And this grid-supported theme isn’t compatible with legacy web browsers such as Internet Explorer. There are lots of work to be done and building this design system should be the first step.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that I make reasonable progress on the design system, I will post updates to this website so that everyone can see what I’ve been doing, and this will push me to take action.</p>

When it comes to safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese Communist Party has gotten it absolutely right to protest U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit of the Taiwan Province, but it should do more to show the People's Republic of China's resolve to confront separatism and foreign interference.

Long before Pelosi landed in Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry had protested multiple times calling for the United States of America to cancel the visit with warnings of retaliation. Despite all these diplomatic efforts, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House and the 3rd ranking member in the line of power of America, landed in Taiwan and met with Tsai Ing-wen.

In response to this insult on China's vital national interest, the Chinese government took a whole-of-government approach to respond to the engagement between high-level Taiwan and U.S. officials. These included visa restrictions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, import and export restrictions from the Ministry of Commerce and unprecedented military drills from the Chinese People's Liberation Army of the Ministry of National Defence, as well as sanctions imposed by the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office. 

This sanction package sends a clear message to the Democractic Progressive Party in Taiwan and the United States that secession has no place in China. However, most of these countermeasures are harming Taiwan civilians with little impact on the ruling political party DPP and the United States authority. 

Pelosi's trip to Taiwan is unprecedented. As a high-ranking U.S. official, whether executive, legislative and judicial branches are separated or not, her visit to Taiwan is a serious violation of the One-China policy. There is only one China in the world, so is there only one One-China policy that is valid. It is the policy introduced by the People's Republic of China, not the self-made U.S. version or other editions. 

Considering the fact that China has warned multiple times of consequences and urged Pelosi not to visit Taiwan, her trip to Taiwan is Pelosi's choice. Hence, it is reasonable for China to impose sanctions on the U.S. Speaker of the House, fellow U.S. officials who joined the trip, as well as U.S. military persons who are on the U.S. aircraft carrier near Taiwan. Sanctioning a high-ranking U.S. official would send a clear and strong message to Washington D.C. that no one is above China's resolve to safteguard its interests and security, and the People's Republic of China is unafraid of challenging those who seek to harm with forceful response regardless of their identities.

I"<p>Kaggle is a wonderful place for doing data science projects, sharing insights with other data scientists and the public as well as a place for finding interesting projects to practise data science skills.</p>

<p>Today, I’ve decided to use this platform to complete three projects at the beginner level to demonstrate my professional skills. Whilst I’m not a beginner data scientist, it’s been a long time since the last time I participate in a complex data analytics project. I created a Kaggle account a year ago but haven’t utilised this
platform for learning data science.</p>

<p>This is a perfect acid test to see how I can effectively use Kaggle to acquire knowledge and skills in the field of data science. I will follow Ken Jee’s YouTube videos to complete these beginner projects and post them on my Kaggle profile as well as this website. You will find more details with regard to this plan and the three projects in future articles as well as the Research section of this website.</p>

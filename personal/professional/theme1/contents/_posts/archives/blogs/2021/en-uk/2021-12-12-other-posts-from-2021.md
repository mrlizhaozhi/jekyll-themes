<p>I archive posts from the Blogs section to keep the website current whilst older posts remain accessible to the public. Posts from 2021 and 2020 have been archived at:</p>

<p>1) <a href="/blogs/archives/2021/">Archived posts from 2021</a></p>

<p>2) <a href="/blogs/archives/2020/">Archived posts from 2020</a></p>

<p>Whilst I managed to archive HTML and markdown posts from the past two years,  articles that were published as PDF documents are not available in these archives. I have; however, uploaded these articles to the current website. These posts are now available at:</p>

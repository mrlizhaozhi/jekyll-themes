	The Research Centre offers programmes in numerous fields such as data science, artificial intelligence 
	and web development, etc. These are curated curriculum designed to acquire knowledge and skills in these 
	fields and sharing with the public research progress.

		&lt;h1&gt;Data Science&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Data is becoming increasingly important. We're producing data every day. By analysing the data that customers produce, companies can provide better, personalised products and services.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Data can be quantitative or qualitative, which may include numbers, texts, images, audios, and videos. Whether you run an e-commerce website or a social media application, you need this data as well as the appropriate technologies to get to know your customers and make the most out of your data pipeline.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			R and Python are popular programming languages for data science. I've learned them both in college. I aspire to become a business intelligence analyst or a data scientist. Therefore, my research includes data analysis with R and Python. I will learn the basics of these tools, use them to analyse and visualise different types of data, and build machine learning models with existing open-source or in-house frameworks and libraries.

		&lt;h1&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I'm interested in AI because of I believe in its power and potential to transform industries and 
			advance humanity. AI software and hardware are much more meaningful than social media, video 
			streaming and other purely digital products and services. It will become the new engine of economies
			and societies.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			I'm interested in learning AI technology and applying it to solve issues both in business and science
			worlds. I hope by launching the Artificial Intelligence Programme, I will be able to systematically 
			and methodically acquire AI knowledge and skills and share my progress with the public.

		&lt;h1&gt;Web Development&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In the foreseeable future, the Internet will continue to be the primary platform through which 
			people search for information and acquire knowledge. As the Internet evolves, it has become 
			more powerful, useful and impactful.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			I developed a passion for web development since taking that web-based applications course in school.
			I still find designing and building feature-rich, visually appealing websites an enjoyable experience.
			I love building products that people are willing to use to meed their changing demands.
			&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
			Following the introduction of Web3, this space is now more exciting than ever before. I'm keen to 
			acquire knowledge and skills in web development. This Programme will help me acquire web technologies
			such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, etc.

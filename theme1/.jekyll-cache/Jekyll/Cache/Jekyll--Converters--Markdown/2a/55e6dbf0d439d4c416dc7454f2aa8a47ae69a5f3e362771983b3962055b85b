I".<p>In a previous post, I discussed the importance of building a design system to help strengthen my web development skills. Today, Iâ€™m sketching a roadmap toward Web Success.</p>

<p>To succeed as a web developer - a professional full-stack developer - I must master the front and back end. I should focus on the front end first because its easier and cheaper. And I must pick up the back end as well after grasping the front.</p>

<p>Here is the roadmap:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As the first step, I should acquire knowledge and skills in front-end development, learning to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and their frameworks and libraries to build stunning web pages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After learning the front, I should start learning the back. I should start by learning PHP, Python, their respective frameworks and libraries and content management systems such as Drupal and WordPress to build database-driven websites and applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I should rent a custom domain and operate a website and utilize web analytics solutions to run the digital brand successfully, whether it is a dynamic blog or an e-commerce store.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Following these steps, I should be able to grasp the fundamentals as well as more advanced techniques in web application development.</p>

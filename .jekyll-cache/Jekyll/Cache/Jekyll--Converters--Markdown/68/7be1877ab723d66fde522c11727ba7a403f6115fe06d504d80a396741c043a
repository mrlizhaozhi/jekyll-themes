I"A<p>It has been some time since the release of the Action Plan on strengthening web development skills through building a full-stack web design system. Unfortunately, this Action Plan has not been strictly implemented. This is the result of deficiencies in the design of the Plan. In the coming days, I will revise and republish this Action Plan to ensure that a timetable is set forth for achieving the strategic goals set in the original Plan.</p>

<p>The revised Action Plan will continue to focus on the mission of building and releasing a full-stack web design system that is flexible, capable, and accessible, which will enable all developers to build their applications faster and easier.</p>

<p>The Action Plan will be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound. The Plan will incorporate this model to refine the instructions and rules to make sure that tangible outcomes will be achieved following the Plan. The Plan will also include a new section called Implementation, which specifies how to implement the plan and what consequences will have for failing to meet targets.</p>

<p>The updated Action Plan will serve as a clearer guide for completing the development of the long-awaited Design System. This will be a great learning opportunity for me to learn web development and master the nuts and bolts.</p>

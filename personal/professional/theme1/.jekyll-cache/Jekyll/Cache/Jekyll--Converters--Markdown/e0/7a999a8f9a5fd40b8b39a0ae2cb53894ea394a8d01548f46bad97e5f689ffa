I"ê<p>Since the birth of the internet, the world has been moving towards digitisation. And the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend in the past three years. As we become reliant on digital services for work and life and service providers start to recognise the value of data, we‚Äôre more exposed to all kinds of security risks than ever before. The stake can‚Äôt be higher.</p>

<p>Service providers collect and analyse our data to personalise their products and services to better serve customers like you and me. Whilst appropriate acquisition and use of data can enhance products, services and customer experiences, misuse of data can put our interests and security at immense risk. We must be cautious when dealing with data and sceptical when choosing service providers.</p>

<h1>"Whilst appropriate acquisition and use of data can enhance products, services and customer experiences, misuse of data can put our interests and security at immense risk."</h1>

<p>Being self-disciplined in the digital space is critical. It means 1) keeping track of our online activities, 2) knowing which services have access to our data, 3) understanding the level and type of risks we‚Äôre exposed to and 4) taking decisive action to confront security threats to protect our interests and security. We must recognise digital risks and actively monitor and mitigate them.</p>

<p>Tracking online activities helps us understand what services have our data and to what extend they have access to this data. We must track how we‚Äôre using these services as well. Search engines like Baidu and Google may have stored our search queries, social media applications like WeChat and Tencent QQ may have access to our posts, conversations and possibly data from other applications on our devices, etc. Data like these are what service providers hunt for, and we must keep track of our digital footprint to identify threats.</p>

<p>We must also be aware of the level and type of risk that we‚Äôre potentially exposed to. This will help us understand the risks and thereby making our risk mitigation strategies more effective. Services that do not have an account deletion feature can put our data at stake by having access to our data eternally; connected accounts can put our data at risk if any one of these accounts is compromised; email subscriptions can expose our data to risks if we lose our email accounts while automated system emails that contain our data continue to be sent to those accounts, etc. These types of risks will bring consequences of different levels. We must recognise, monitor and confront them in every possible way.</p>

<p>The risk level ranked from low to high shall be texts &lt; images &lt; audios &lt; videos. We must know what types of data we‚Äôre supplying to each service. Public platforms expose us to greater risks than private platforms. Platforms are considered public if a broad, unknown audience has access to the posts published on the platforms. Baidu and Weibo are some of the most prominent public platforms. To protect our interests and security from harms, we shouldn‚Äôt post information that reveal ourselves on public platforms.</p>

<p>By cautiously dealing with our data and actively taking steps to mitigate digital security threats, we can make our digital life more secure and rewarding. We must always prioritise our interests and security, keep our eyes wide open when dealing with our data and use only trusted services.</p>

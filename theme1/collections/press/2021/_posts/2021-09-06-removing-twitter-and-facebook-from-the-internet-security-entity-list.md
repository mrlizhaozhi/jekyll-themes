Today, I'm removing Twitter and Facebook from the Internet Security Entity List, effective 7 September 2021 at 5:00 PM. These two applications were added to the 
Entity List due to security risks associated with opaque community rules and restrictions imposed on account following. 

Following this removal, all restrictions imposed on these software products are lifted. The Internet Security Entity List is a tool for identifying and prohibiting
the use of certain applications that imply security risks.

If any evidence suggesting security risks surface in the future, Twitter and Facebook may be added to the Entity List again.

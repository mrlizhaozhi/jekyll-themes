I"Œ<p>I enjoy web development despite having no plan to make it my lifelong profession. Web development is fun and useful. Today, every successful business has a great website. Maintaining an online precense in crucial for brands to stay relevant and stand out from their competitors. Successful websites should be able to attract and retain customers, helping them to get familiarized with you and your work. 
<br /><br />
Developers around the world rely heavily on open source to speed up production and free time for creativity. This is exactly why Iâ€™m planning on building my own web frameworks. Iâ€™ve created a GitHub code repository for sharing my programs at <a href="https://github.com/mrlizhaozhi/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a>. This repository includes all the common components such as navbars, footers, carousels, and many more, that are expected on a dynamic, fully functional website.
<br /><br />
I invite all of you to fork this repository and check out my work, make suggestions, and even edit my code. Perhaps, Iâ€™ll write some posts to explain how I designed and developed these widgets. Please stay tuned!

I"i<p>Today, I conclude my first week as an HSBC employee. This’s a special and celebratory moment. In the coming years, I will have more days, weeks and months with the global financial services organisation. I will take on more challenging, complex projects and heavier responsibility as I advance in my HSBC career as a Global Operations Graduate Trainee.
<br /><br />
I’m pleased with my assignments so far. These assignments allow me to integrate my financial and technical expertise to make an impact on one of the largest and oldest banks in the world. HSBC has such a unqiue environment in which I can do what I enjoy and learn from everyone else. 
<br /><br />
Next week, I will participate in the Global Graduate Induction in which I will meet management trainees from across the HSBC Group and the Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn. I will also deliver my first ever assignment at the end of the week. Assignments are challenging in a good way. They challenge me to think creatively, take risks and create value for the business. These’re great learning opportunities. They’re not easy but definitely manageable. 
<br /><br />
Moving forward, I will do my best to get to know the organisation, get to know the people, familiarise myself with the business and actively acquire knowledge and skills to contribute to my functional area and the HSBC Group.

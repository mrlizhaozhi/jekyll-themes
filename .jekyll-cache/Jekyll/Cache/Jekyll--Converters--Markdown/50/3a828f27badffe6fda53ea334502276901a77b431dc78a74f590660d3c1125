I"à<p>23 years ago in 1999, a missile from the United States-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) hit the Chinese Embassy in Yulgoslavia, injuring more than two dozen staffers and killed three reporters. The 48-year-old Shao Yunhuan from Xinhua, the 31-year-old Xu Xinhu from Guangming and his 28-year-old wife Zhu Yin all died in this shocking incident.</p>

<p>The embassy is a symbol of sovereignty, nation, and people. The deadly assult on the Chinese embassy is a direct assult on China and the respected Chinese civilisation and people. We must remember those who suffered and not to repeat this tragic history.</p>

<p>Today, in the North, NATO allies continue to label the People‚Äôs Republic of China a ‚ÄúStrategic Competitor‚Äù, echoing Washington D.C.‚Äôs unfounded claims and conspiracies, disseminating disinformation about China‚Äôs missions.</p>

<p>NATO seeks to expand beyond its current geographical zone to encompass the rest of Europe and stretch into Asia. This expansionist agenda has become a trigger in the ongoing military conflict between the Kremlin in Russia and the regime in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Might can‚Äôt make right. Whilst the United States and NATO keeps ‚Äúsafeguarding the rules-based international order‚Äù a mantra, we must see the truth and keep those who seek harm out of our regions.</p>

<p>Our hearts go to those who suffered and murdered in the NATO bombardment. China should always be a force for good to deescalate tensions through meaningful dialogues and other peaceful means. We will continue to call out the United States and NATO‚Äôs hypocrasies and blatant threat to peace and stability all across this world.</p>

I"ü"<p>In a <a href="/unbelievable-youtube-has-denied-me-and-hundreds-and-southands-of-other-users-worldwide-for-deleting-unused-channels/">previous post</a>
I complained about YouTube depriving me and many other users of access to its video sharing and streaming 
service simply because we deleted our unused account. At the time of this writing, I‚Äôm still stuck in this
uncomfortable situation like many others. My access to YouTube.com hasn‚Äôt been stored, and I still can‚Äôt 
find a way to contact YouTube‚Äôs representatives to have this issue addressed. Engineering is supposed to make
things easy. Deleting data shouldn‚Äôt take this long. In this blog post, I‚Äôd like to share from my point of
video how YouTube can improve its customer service so that both the business and its customers like you and
me can better off in situations like this.</p>

<p>YouTube has grown rapidly into a global video sharing service with thousands and millions of users consuming
information from YouTube on a daily basis worldwide. YouTube was acquired by Google in the last decade and 
had since expanding across multiple disciplines and markets. Just like other Google services, YouTube has 
an official help centre where users come to find solutions to their concerns with YouTube‚Äôs products. To 
manage such a huge customer base, YouTube‚Äôs help centre incorporates modern technologies to make it as smart
as possible. Hiring hundreds of people responding to similar questions related to YouTube isn‚Äôt cost effective.
From my experience, the help centre is designed to be autonomous, meaning that it requires as less time from
YouTube‚Äôs staff as possible.</p>

<p>The help centre has a search bar. When users type in their questions, the search tool will generate a list of 
threads from help forums posted by other users, prompting users to search for answers from existing threads. 
Whilst this setup can free up a lot of time from YouTube‚Äôs employees, it‚Äôs troublesome in some rare cases like 
mine.</p>

<p>Since removing my channel with no original uploads, likes, or comments, with just six playlists built from 
videos uploaded by other users and a hundred subscriptions, I‚Äôve been locked out from YouTube account. Whenever
I try to sign in to YouTube with my Google account, it always displays an error page with a message saying that
I can‚Äôt sign in while my data is being deleted. I understand that data deletion can take some time as I‚Äôm a 
web developer myself. However, after one hour, three days, now an entire week, I start to get more irritating as I continue to
be blocked out from the largest video community in the world for doing nothing in violation of YouTube‚Äôs policies
or anything wrong or unethical. This puts me - and users who‚Äôre in similar situations - in a very uncomfortable
place.</p>

<p>I search all over the Web for solutions to fix this problem. I see many threads online complaining about the same
issue. The oldest post was made in 2015. There‚Äôre more recent posts as well. There‚Äôre countless complaints on this
bug on Quora, Reddit, and YouTube‚Äôs very own help forum. None of these included a solution - either from users 
who suffered from this nonsense or from representatives at YouTube. So I visited YouTube‚Äôs help centre in hope to
get in touch with some customer support specialists.</p>

<p>The help centre, whether you start with the search bar on the front page or click through contact options, you‚Äôre 
always prompted to enter your question in a wizard, and that wizard will always pop up some close threads related to
the issue. All of them are authored by users, and none of them offered a solution. There isn‚Äôt a way to hold a live c
chat with a customer service representitive or write an email to YouTube to report the issue. I‚Äôm not even a professional
YouTuber. Just imagine how frustrated would be for YouTubers and businesses that rely on the site for a living when 
they‚Äôre put through this chaos.</p>

<p>I believe there‚Äôre many ways for YouTube to improve its customer support solution so that everyone ‚Äì both the company
and its customers ‚Äì will better off. I think YouTube‚Äôs current strategy is working. An automated help centre is a fit for
organisations of YouTube‚Äôs size. However, there‚Äôre many details that YouTube can refashion and refine.</p>

<p>First, YouTube should do more work to make its help centre effective. Rather than pointing users to a list of threads,
YouTube should develop mechanisms to rate the quality of the threads and solutions offered in these threads. Threads without
accepted solutions should remain open to new input whether or not they‚Äôre active. I see a dozen thread on YouTube complaining
about exactly the same problem. This shouldn‚Äôt have happened. It‚Äôs frustrating to click and read through all the posts.
This is time-consuming and ineffective. YouTube should aggregate the threads, use algorithms or manual labour to combine
threads on same topics. Stack Overflow ‚Äì the professional developer community ‚Äì has been doing a fabulous job at this.
When users visit the centre, they expect to get their answers as quickly and effortlessly as possible. Who doesn‚Äôt want to
save their precious time? By combining threads, users can find relevant content much easier.</p>

<p>Second, replies to thread questions that offer no value should be removed after some time. 
It makes no sense to repeat what others have said. I‚Äôve seen in many of the threads many users are simply replicating the
complaints.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>‚ÄúYes, I encountered the same issue. Please help!‚Äù</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening, I‚Äôve been looking all over the place and still find no clue‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Posts like these add little to no value to the help forum threads. These should be removed either periodically or after a solution
has been identified and accepted. Online customer service is much more than providing a place for customers to vant. It should
put customers at the centre and help them achieve their objectives. It shouldn‚Äôt stop untile customer demands are fulfilled.</p>

<p>Third, there should be a human service option somewhere. YouTube simply can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt rely upon automation to serve
its customers. Whilst the wizards are in one way or another effective in addressing users‚Äô concerns, not all issues can be addressed
in the user community without engagement with corporate representatives. Afterall, YouTube is the provider who created the service,
no one knows better about YouTube than YouTube.</p>

<p>Some months ago, I had a problem with my Autodesk account. Autodesk is another prominent software provider with offerings that 
include some of the most widely used industrial design software solutions such as Fusion and AutoCad. The customer service 
from Autodesk was far more superior than that of YouTube. Whilst I wasn‚Äôt able to log into my account, I was able to hold a live
chat with company representatives who very patiently analyse my issue, walked me through some solutions, provided me an email 
address to follow up on the problem, and, after everything failed, the representative handed me over to another specialist to assist 
me until I successfully fixed the problem. This is what quality customer service should look like. It‚Äôs approachable, charming, and
effective. In the case of YouTube, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being treated fairly. There really isn‚Äôt a customer service.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be for YouTube to rate the threads and solutions using either an algorithmatic solution or
human service specialist. If a thread contains a working solution, then the wizard should prompt the user to view that thread first.
If the user concludes that the thread isn‚Äôt helping, there should be a place for the user to provide feedback by rating the thread and solution.
Then, YouTube should encourage the user to offer more details by creating a new thread and inviting some <em>real human representatives</em> 
from YouTube to participate in the thread or hold a live chart or have some back and forth email communications to help address issues. 
YouTube may also collect customer feedback on their service to understand customers demands and expectations better. Help forums shoud 
include not only inputs from users but also inputs from YouTube.</p>

<p>I believe by making these changes, both YouTube and its customers can be better off. YouTube can maintain a good reputation and 
higher quality service while customers can have their concerns effective addressed. These are all I have come up with as of now. 
I will update this article to include more solutions for YouTube to make its customer service better.</p>

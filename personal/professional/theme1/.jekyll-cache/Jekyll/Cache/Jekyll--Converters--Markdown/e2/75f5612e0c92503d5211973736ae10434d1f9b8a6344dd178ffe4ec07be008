I"ì<p>Hobbies can be sources of strength, resilience and growth. We need to understand what we want or what we care to paint the full picture of life. Hobbies can be relevant to our professions, our interests or our sense of responsibility for people around us and society, etc. When we develop these hobbies, we are making our life more enjoyable and fruitful. Life is short, so weâ€™d better have something to do for ourselves after stressful work hours. Hobbies are what we do solely for ourselves.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m glad to share that after months, or even years, of search, I can finally announce that web development and character animation are my hobbies. These hobbies can bring me joy, relief me from burden, best of all, they can be developed in careers should I invest in time and effort to sharpen my skills.</p>

<p>I love web development because it gives me a sense of accomplishment â€“ something I consider critical because I need this to boost my self-esteem. It makes me feel that all the hard work worth it. Moving forward, I will dive deep into the field. I must roll out action plans to sharpen my Web skills, enhance the website that I built, and complete and release the full-stack web design system announced at the beginning of 2022 no matter how much time and effort it takes. Should I successfully complete these ambitious projects, I will more likely be able to secure commercial contracts and become a well-paid, reputable freelance web developer.</p>

<p>Character animation is also my hobby. I love it because itâ€™s creative, aesthetic, and entertaining. I fell in love with cartoons just as other kids in childhood. I wanted to be an animator after growing up when I was young. This dream still lives inside me, and it has a shot to become a reality. As COVID-19, the Ukraine crisis, and economic distress make this world more negative and unpredictable, we need sources of hope, faith and positivity. I have no doubt that animation is one such much-needed sources of power.</p>

<p>Animation is a comprehensive form of the arts. It comprises design, music, and storytelling to deliver amazing, unforgettable experiences and messages. It brings families closer together and laughter to our world. It is also proven that independent films are usually more successful than commercial films in terms of creativity. As the Chinese animation industry continues to make breakthroughs, independent animation will have a pivotal role to play in revitalising this important sector. I have decided to invest in time and effort to refresh my art and design skills. I want to put these skills into practice to bring joy to my audience.</p>

<p>After identifying hobbies, it is vital to keep developing them. This process will be a rewarding, enjoyable one because hobbies are about what we like and care. It is something that we take personally and we do it voluntarily not because we are asked to do so as at work. I encourage you all to explore hobbies, get to know yourselves, and reserve time and energy to develop these hobbies.</p>

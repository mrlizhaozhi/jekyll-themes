[FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE]
<br><br>
Today, I announce to delay the launch of the new research website mentioned in a <a href="https://mrlizhaozhi.github.io/blogs/2021-07/on-the-introduction-of-a-new-research-website/">previous press release</a>. The new launch date will be announced in a separate press release.
<br><br>
This extension is due to two reasons: 1) I've determined that it is necessary for me to acquire more technical skills before I can put together a website successfully and 2) I believe it is more important and therefore reasonable to devote more time to learning Excel, project management, and data analysis with R and Python. 
<br><br>
However, I still believe that a new research website is necessary for tracking my progress and sharing knowledge. Therefore, I will, for sure, launch a new website dedicated to my research activities.

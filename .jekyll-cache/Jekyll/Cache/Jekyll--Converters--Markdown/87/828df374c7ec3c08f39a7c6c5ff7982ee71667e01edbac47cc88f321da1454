I"y<p>I perfectly understand the importance of continuous learning. Learning is the only way to stay ahead and grow. There’s no shortcut to success other than learning every day, step by step. Whilst I have a lot to learn, I must prioritise some learning activities to make sure that I acquire the most needed knowledge and skills at work first. 
<br /><br />
Moving forward, I will prioritise my learnings at the beginning of each month and reflect on my progress in the middle and at the end of each month. In August 2021, my learning priorities are 1) understanding the document checking procedure (the team’s overall responsibility in credit services and collateral management utility as well as its impact on HSBC.); 2) learning the fundamentals of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming and Microsoft Excel (Excel) using a variety of resources; and 3) continue learning the basics of Python and its application in data analytics. Finally, I should also complete the Alteryx training sessions as scheduled by the company.
<br /><br />
Whilst I remain interested in web development, I won’t make it my lifelong career. Hence, I will temporarily postpone my learnings with regard to web application development. I will; however, resume my research in web development when I have time and in the condition that won’t affect making progress in key learning priorities.

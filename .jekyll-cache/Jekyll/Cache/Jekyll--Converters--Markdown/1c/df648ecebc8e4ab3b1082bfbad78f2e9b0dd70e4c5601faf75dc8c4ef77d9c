I";	<p>Happy Chinese New Year! Tomorrow, 31st January 2022, is the New Year’s Eve (除夕). I’ll travel to Guilin to celebrate the Year of the Tiger with my family. 2022 is the first year I get to celebrate in person with my family since 2017. I spent the last four years attending school in the United States, so I wasn’t able to return home and celebrate with my family and friends in China. I look forward to this family reunion trip.</p>

<p>Looking back at 2021, I achieved quite a few accomplishments. Whilst COVID-19 variants continued to storm across the globe, 2021 is a key milestone. I graduated from Marquette University in May 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Finance and Information Systems, marking the end of university life and the official beginning of adulthood.</p>

<p>I returned to China subsequently in June. I’ve not been able to fly home since the virus spreaded across the world and severely impacted air travel and movements. In July, I received the offer call from HSBC, and I joined this organisation in late July as Global Operations Graduate Trainee. This is my first full-time job.</p>

<p>Last Friday, I wrapped up my first rotation at the international bank. Over the course of the past six months, I was put in charge of four process enhancement and automation projects. I got opportunities to build an Excel VBA-powered tool to help new colleagues grasp the basics of our business and used Alteryx Designer to build automation solutions that helped speeding up tedious, repetitive tasks across the bank’s Hang Seng business, which enhanced customer experience through shortening wait time.</p>

<p>2021 wasn’t a year without challenges. I failed numerous job assessments and interviews and got my Alteryx Certificate revoked. These challenges present opportunities for growth. I learned a lot about project management in professional setting. I learned to manage stakeholder relationships, communicate ideas, and collaborate with colleagues more effectively.</p>

<p>2022 is another big year for me. I will transition into a business analyst role, a job that I aspire to. I have a lot more learnings to do to seize opportunities. I’m confident that the Web Master and Data Analytics and Intelligence Programmes will help me prepare for a bright career future. I look forward to a fruitful year to come in 2022!</p>

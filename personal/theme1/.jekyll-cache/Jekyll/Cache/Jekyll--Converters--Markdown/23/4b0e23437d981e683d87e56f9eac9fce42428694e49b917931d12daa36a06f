I"/<p>Yesterday I’ve gotten my first assignment at HSBC. In just one week, I will start my journey at this international financial institution as a participant in the Global Operations Graduate Programme. To succeed on the job, I must keep learning.
<br /><br />
I came across the book <i>Practical Statistic for Data Scientists (with R and Python)</i> recently. I’m using this book to review the basics of statistics and learn the basics of statistical machine learning. R and Python are popular programming languages that business analysts and data scientists use to analyse and visualize data. I believe this book will provide me with the toolkit needed for my job at HSBC.
<br /><br />
In addition, I’m using the <a href="https://statslectures.com"><i>Marin Stats Lectures</i></a> video tutorials to review the fundamentals of statistics and the R programming language. I’ll finish this course first before reading <i>Practical Statistics for Data Scientists.</i>
<br /><br />
As I go over these materials, I will make posts to share my learning experience.</p>

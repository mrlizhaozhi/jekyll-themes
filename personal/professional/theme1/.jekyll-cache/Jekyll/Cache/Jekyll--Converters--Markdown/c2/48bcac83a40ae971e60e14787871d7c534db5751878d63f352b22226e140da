I"c<p>In addition to web development and animation, I’m adding data science and artificial intelligence to my list of hobbies.</p>

<p>Data science is the science of using data to retrieve insight that supports sound judgement and strategic decision making. I love cracking analytics challenges with computing technologies such as Python and SQL. I also enjoy getting to know business and society by analysing data to retrieve actionable insight. I’m rolling out an action plan to strengthen my analytics and data governance skills.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence is an emerging technology, or a set of emerging technologies, that will inevitably transform the way we work and live. With AI, computers are getting much more powerful than human beings. Computers are more capable in a range of scientific research and production activities than ever before. I’m interested in learning AI and leveraging this technology to create value for society. Similarly, I’m writing a plan to acquire knowledge and strengthen skills in this subject area.</p>

<p>With all that being said, I look forward to exploring my passions in art and design through animation, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through web development, data science and artificial intelligence. Moreover, I’m in the process of identifying additional passions such as those in business.</p>

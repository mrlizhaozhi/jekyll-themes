I"<p>Friendships, and indeed, all relationships should be reciprocal, respectful, and trust-based. Relationships that fail to meet these criteria should be discontinued.</p>

<p>This morning, I designated He Haofan (Chinese: 何灏帆), a WeChat contact and a classmate in middle school, for her decision to flag a post I shared on the social media platform and blocking me access to her WeChat Moments immediately after the flagging.</p>

<p>WeChat Moments is a place where users can share information and opinions with their friend circles. I always welcome contacts in my network to read, comment and share the posts I make there. Advancement is enabled when ideas clash and people hold constructive, respectful conversations. I welcome conversations of this type that enables the exchange of ideas. WeChat Moments’ Chinese name is Friend Circle, implying that the posts should be crafted for the access of friends, and only friends should have access to posts published there. He Haofan’s decision illustrates her distrust in our friendship.</p>

<p>He’s decision to silently flag a post from my account containing information on how the United States used data science in diplomatic research, resulting in the removal of the post is a blatant assault on our relationship. The shared article is accessible within the PRC’s Great Firewall, so it’s legal to share such content.</p>

<p>In response to these hostile actions and to uphold reciprocity, respect and trust in relationships, I decided to designate this individual. After the designation goes into effect, He Haofan has been blocked from accessing my WeChat Moments and removed from my network.</p>

<p>I strive to become a value-driven, mission-oriented person. That means acting in line with the values and principles that I believe in. Relationships should be reciprocal, respectful and trust-based is one such principle that I truly believe. Should activities contrary to these vital values and principles uncovered, I will not hesitate to impose sanctions on those who carry out these activities.</p>

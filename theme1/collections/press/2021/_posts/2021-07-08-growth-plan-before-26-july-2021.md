I just got home from the driver license testing site. I did pretty well on the exam - achieved 96 out of 100 points. 
<br><br>
Now, before 26 July 2021 when I get on-board HSBC, I need to roll out a growth plan - a plan that guides me to learn the necessary skills to succeed on the job as an operations manager at this global financial institution.
<br><br>
I've attended two events with my colleagues at HSBC so far. We had insightful conversations with the 2020 programme cohort as well as my peers from the 2021 cohort. These are great learning opportunities to familiarize me with the programme, the organization, and the financial services industry.
<br><br>
Many of the speakers mentioned Microsoft Excel and project management on the Zoom meetings. They believe every participant in HSBC's Global Operations Graduate Programme should master these skills. While the company will provide the training necessary for new hires to succeed on their posts, I believe it is better to get started to learn these skills prior to on-boarding. 
<br><br>
As such, I will devote the next couple of weeks to learning data analysis and project management principles, models, and tools. I believe this early preparation will help me stand out from the cohort and be recognized by the senior leaders at the HSBC bank.
<br><br>
As I learn these skills, I will publish blog posts on my website. Please visit the blog page for updates.

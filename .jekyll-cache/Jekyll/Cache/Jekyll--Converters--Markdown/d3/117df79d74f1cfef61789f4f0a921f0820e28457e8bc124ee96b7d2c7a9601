I"<p>The Office of Li Zhaozhi has launched the Free and Open Internet Programme to counter unjustified, politically-driven government censorship. A free and open internet is good for all. Government officials can use it as a forum to discuss and formulate public-serving policies, scholars can use it to query and gather useful data and information to support research and others can use it to form communities and stay connected.</p>

<p>The Free and Open Internet Programme is designed to secure freedom and openness on the internet. This is achieved through public advocacy, development and adoption of firewall bypassing tools such as virtual private network (VPN), shadowsocks and v2ray applications, and other promotional activities designed to educate the public on the importance of a free and open internet as well as ways to get access to this internet from all corners of the world.</p>

<p>The Programme is against unjustified, politically-driven censorship usually carried out by government such as those imposed by the Chinese Communist Party’s government of the People’s Republic of China.</p>

<p>Through the Free and Open Internet Programme, people worldwide will learn about the dangers of censorship and create tools to secure their freedoms and rights in the digital world.</p>

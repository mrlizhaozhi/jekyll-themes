I"'<p>In a previous post, I discussed how Gitee could have a bright future by lifting some of the restrictions arbitrarily imposed on its users. I’m shocked to learn from news that instead of lifting restrictions, Gitee has imposed even more severe restrictions on users, turning all open-source code respositories private and requiring users to resubmit requests for human moderators to approve for republication of these repositories.</p>

<p>These new restrictions make it even more unpleasant to use Gitee’s services. It is openly against the spirit of open source. Undoubtedly, more developers have chosen to leave Gitee for GitHub and other foreign alternatives. This will be a great loss for Gitee. Since I couldn’t find evidence that indicate this move was requested by the Chinese government, I perceive this policy change to be one made by Gitee’s management. The internet censorship mandated by the Communist Party-dominated Chinese government is cruel enough, certainly people don’t want service providers to execebate this discomfort.</p>

<p>The United States has demonstrated to the world that it is willing to use sanctions and all measures to penalize governments that do not obey by its will. This is evidenced in its multiple designations against Chinese officials and privately owned companies. China needs an open source ecosystem invulnerable to U.S. extraterritorial implementation of local law, but Gitee can’t win this initiative if it keeps imposing unwanted restrictions on its services, making it difficult to work on the platform and boosting the attractiveness of GitHub, GitLab and other Western alternatives.</p>

<p>Given that Gitee’s decision has affected the projects I open source on the platform, I’m reconsidering my approach to Gitee and will make an update on this website.</p>

I"F<p>Today, I’m launching the official course website for the Python for Data Science course. This course is offered online and brought by the Data Science Programme at the Research Centre at the Office of Li Zhaozhi. This website is accessible at <a href="/en-uk/research/courses/python-for-data-science/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Python for Data Science is an introductory course designed to help beginners get started with Python for data science and experienced professionals to refresh their computational and analytical skills. This course is ideal for those who are interested in learning Python for data science. There’re a lot of books and courses out there with a similar goal, but most of them presume participants to have some understanding of either Python programming or mathematics and statistics. This is not the case for this course.</p>

<p>If you’re ONLY interested in Python for analytics, this is the perfect choice for you. You don’t need to build websites, games to learn Python. You will learn computational data science right away with exercises focused on data big and small throughout the course.</p>

<p>This website offers resources such as links to online resources, lecture notes, and exercises for interested people to take and complete the course. As I update the course content, I will post more to this website. It is recommended to visit the site from a desktop or laptop computer and with connection to VPN if you’re from mainland China to get the optimal browsing experience.</p>

<p>Visit the website today to get started on Python programming for data science!</p>

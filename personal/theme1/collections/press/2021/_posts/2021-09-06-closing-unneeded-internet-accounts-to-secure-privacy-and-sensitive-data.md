Today, I'm closing several internet accounts that I haven't used for quite some time. This practice is consistent with my security strategy. 

Leaving profiles containing sensitive information that reveals your identity such as pictures, profession and network accessible to the public poses a significant security risk. 

To mitigate this risk, it's strongly recommended to close the accounts that you don't need immediately and carefully evaluate the pros and cons before opening an account on any platform. It's 
each and everyone of us's responsibility to take action to address potential security risks. 

We must do whatever it takes to deprive malicious cyber actors of access to 
sensitive data that can be exploited to harm our interests and security and the people who we care about.

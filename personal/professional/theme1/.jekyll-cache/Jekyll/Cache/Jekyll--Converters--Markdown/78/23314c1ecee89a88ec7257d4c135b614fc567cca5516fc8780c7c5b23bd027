	This website is developed with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It is designed to be a platform for 
	introducing me as a professional and individual. With the navigation menu, you can reach most if not 
	all parts of this website. Take your time to explore and you will find out that this site is much larger
	than it appears at the first glance!

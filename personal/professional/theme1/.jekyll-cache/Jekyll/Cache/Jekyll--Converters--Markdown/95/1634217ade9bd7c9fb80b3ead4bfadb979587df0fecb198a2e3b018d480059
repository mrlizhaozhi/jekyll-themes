I"S	<p>Dear Stack Overflowers,</p>

<p>Thank you for your support. After thorough consideration, I’ve decided to delete my account and leave this platform. Below, I’m explaining why I made this decision.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow has been a popular Q&amp;A platform for global developers to find answers. It’s many features enable the exchange of ideas and solutions. Like many developers, I visit this forum weekly if not daily; however, I’m getting tired of its restrictions imposed on newcomers. These restrictions discourage participation. They’re self-inflicted and should be lifted to make this community more inclusive.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow claims that reputation points are optional, but you can’t do many things without enough points. These include casting votes to solutions, posting comments and even answering certain forum questions. While I understand the motivation is to ensure that no one can spam this platform, I don’t believe this is a good strategy for meeting this challenge. If developers are unable to share their thoughts simply because they don’t have enough points (level of addiction) on the platform, they can’t contribute, and Stack Overflow won’t be helpful without these contributions. Indeed, many questions posted years ago are left unanswered on Stack Overflow. Even worse, developers can easily lose reputation because someone disagrees with their answers and leaves no valuable feedback.</p>

<p>I’m sick of this rating system. Until Stack Overflow addresses these problems, I will not open an account and contribute to this service. There’re many other forums where I can find solutions to my questions. Stack Overflow isn’t the only option; therefore, I won’t hesitate to reconsider my membership when the service becomes rogue. I’ve written a more detailed post to articulate my concerns on my personal blog website at <a href="https://mrlizhaozhi.bitbucket.io/stack-overflow-should-remove-downvotes-that-discourage-the-spirit-of-helping/">Stack Overflow should remove downvotes that discourage the spirit of helping
</a>. Please give it a read if you agree with me.</p>

<p>So long, Stack Overflow, those of you who have been actively contributing to the community, and those who still can’t because you don’t have enough addiction to this platform.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Zhaozhi</p>

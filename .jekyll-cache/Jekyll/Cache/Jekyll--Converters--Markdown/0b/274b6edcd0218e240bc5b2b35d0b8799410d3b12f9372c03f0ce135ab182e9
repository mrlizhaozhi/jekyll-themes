I":	<p>I started using DewVPN a few years ago when I was studying in the United States. Every summer, when I return home in China, it becomes a headache for me to access the free and open global internet inside the Chinese government’s Great Firewall.</p>

<p>American internet services such as YouTube, Google and Twitter are filled with useful learning resources that are not available on Chinese services, yet all these global internet services are blocked by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) inside the People’s Republic of China (PRC).</p>

<p>The CCP adopts one of the most reckless censorship machines in the world that blocks countless foreign websites and applications. PRC citizens are not allowed to visit these blocked websites and applications and Chinese alternatives are highly restrictive.</p>

<p>VPN’s have been the primary channels for residents in the PRC to access the free, open and uncensored global Web. There’re many reasons for PRC residents to access the global Web – students who wish to study abroad need it for information and learning support, professionals working at multinational companies need access for day-to-day business, researchers need access to databases and papers to aid their studies, and even the CCP needs access to blocked Western sites to promote a positive image of the PRC and its governing model and foreign affairs initiatives, etc. Sometimes without a VPN, GitHub can’t be accessed and this website can’t be maintained. There is no good reason to restrict access to the global internet.</p>

<p>DewVPN is operated by Grand Media Ltd incorporated in British Virgin Islands. It is offered free of charge with military-grade encryption, making it difficult for governments to block its traffics. The app has been working great until yesterday when the app stopped connecting and this morning the official website went down completely. At the time of this writing, the service hasn’t been restored. It’s unclear if it will make a comeback at all.</p>

<p>Internet freedom is a critical backbone of the modern digital economy. All members of society need equal access to information. They have the right to access, process information and make judgements on their own. The fight for freedom on China’s internet must continue. I have no doubt that more people will join this glorious battle.</p>

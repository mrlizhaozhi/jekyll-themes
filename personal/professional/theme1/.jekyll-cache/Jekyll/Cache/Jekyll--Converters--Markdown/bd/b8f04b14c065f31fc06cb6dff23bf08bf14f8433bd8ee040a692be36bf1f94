I"	<p>Today, I will travel to Guilin with my parents to celebrate Chinese New Year with my relatives living in the small tourism city. This is my first time in the last four years to travel to the city and reunion with my family. This has been a highly anticipated trip for me.</p>

<p>In the next couple of days, I will visit my grandpa, aunties and uncles door by door and have reunion dinners with my mother and father’s sides. Surely, this will be another great opportunity to cheer up each other and connect with my counsins and sisters. We may do “young people stuff” together, again.</p>

<p>To record this trip, I will take photos with my phone and camera and share some of them on this website.</p>

<p>I wish you a great holiday and a successful year to come!</p>

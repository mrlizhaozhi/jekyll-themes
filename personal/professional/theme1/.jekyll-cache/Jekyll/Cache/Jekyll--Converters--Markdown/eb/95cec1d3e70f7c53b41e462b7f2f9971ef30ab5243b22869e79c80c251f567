I"4	<p>It’s been four months since I launched the full-stack design system project back in February 2022. Little progress has been made towards completing this project. This is a serious issue because this inaction has put in question my commitment to web development. I must take action to fulfil this strategic goal. Planning is far from enough.</p>

<p>It has been determined that despite having built so many websites, my web programming skills are lacking. I’ve been repeating what I already know without touching new waters. This is a problem. And, I’ve not been active enough in web development, consequently I’m starting to forget what I knew. It’s time to commit to the design system project. It offers a great opportunity to reconnect to the basics.</p>

<p>To succeed in web development, I must be ambitious and committed. I need to review the basics of all the languages used in building web-based applications. I’ve never been skillful in JavaScript programming, yet it is a pillar of the Web foundation. As such, I need to learn JavaScript by doing more with this tool.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I will make and follow an action plan to speed up the development of the long-awaited design system. I need to set milestones and deadline for each component of the design system. My target is to complete and release the first version of the system in October 2022.</p>

<p>I must capture learning opportunities as I build out this design system. I must learn at work through reading documentation, watching tutorials, and putting in extra work to experiment new and better ways to approach web design and application development. I need to learn to create wireframes and diagrams to design applications, I need to test new HTML and CSS techniques, I need to go over the basics of JavaScript, PHP and Python, etc. thoroughly through reading books, watching lectures, and doing programming exercises and projects. I must take action to realise this ambition. It’s not okay now to continue to stand by and do nothing.</p>

<p>It is a serious commitment to release and update the design system. It will help me to strengthen development skills and make it easier for novice and tenured developers to build their applications better and faster. I must continue to innovate, learn and get hands dirty to explore and uncover new knowledge.</p>

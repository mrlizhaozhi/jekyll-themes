I"‡<p>John Flint, the current CEO of the UK Infrastructure Bank and former Group Chief Executive of HSBC, joined a webinar hosted by Oxford University to share insights on leadership, mental health and the financial services and banking industry. The event was live streamed on LinkedIn and YouTube.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from this sharing session. As a current graduate trainee at HSBC, I can imagine how it was when John joined the organisation 30 years ago as a graduate trainee. Leadership is one of the many skills that I urgently need to develop as a professional.</p>

<p>Johnâ€™s decision to build the healthiest human system in the financial industry at HSBC still influences the organisation to this day. Mental health is indeed important to both leaders and colleagues. People are the critical enablers of strategies. For an organisation to sustain growth, it must treat its people well.</p>

<p>John also talked about the ups and downs in his career. An interesting story I learned from him is that he almost resigned from HSBC in 2005. Thatâ€™s something that I didnâ€™t know. The story of how John went from a failed manager to cleaning up the chaos and his manager opened doors to leadership really intrigued me.

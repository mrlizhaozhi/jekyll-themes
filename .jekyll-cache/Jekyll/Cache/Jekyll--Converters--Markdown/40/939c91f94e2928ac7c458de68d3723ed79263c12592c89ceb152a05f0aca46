		The Research Centre at the Office of Li Zhaozhi has a simple yet critical mission: Strengthen technical skills to
		secure opportunities.

	<p>
		I believe continuous learning is important. It is how I can compete and win. To build a strong and growing career,
		I must understand what knowledge and skills I need and how I can acquire them. The Research Centre offers programmes
		that help achieve these objectives.
	</p>
	<p>
		Research programmes are curated learning curriculum in which I get to identify problems, gather data and resources,
		and conduct research to answer those problems. Each programme is designed to acquire knowledge and skills in a subject.
	</p>
	<p>
		For instance, the Data Science Programme offers resources to acquire knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics,
		and computing; the Web Application Programme offers resources to acquire knowledge and skills in web-based application
		development; and the Artificial Intelligence Programme offers resources to acquire AI-related knowledge and skills.

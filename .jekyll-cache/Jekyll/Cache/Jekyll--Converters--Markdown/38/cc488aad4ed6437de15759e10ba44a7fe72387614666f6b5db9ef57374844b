I"í<p>Iâ€™ve heared of Jekyll - the popular static site generator - for some time now. Whilst I got excited about the term â€œstatic site generatorâ€, which wasnâ€™t taught in school, I didnâ€™t have a chance to try this technology out. This week, I finally got the chance.</p>

<p>After discovering that BitBucket Pages is accessible in Mainland China, I decided to relaunch my website that was previously hosted on GitHub Pages - a web hosting platform thatâ€™s blocked in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. This site will be my personal branding platform that features my articles and projects.</p>

<p>Since Iâ€™ve been busy with work, I decided to pick one of the templates that I designed last year and convert it into a Jekyll-powered site. As a front-end lover, I was sceptical about learning Jekyll because itâ€™s based on Ruby and command lines. I had limited knowledge on both technologies. Whilst Iâ€™ve used GitHub for some time, I never actually learned to Git. These challenges got me excited but panic at the same time.</p>

<p>My intuition told me to search on the Web, thatâ€™s what I do when I get stuck or donâ€™t even know where to get started. So, I googled and found an amazing resource on CloudCannon Academy, which teaches you to convert any static template into a fully functional Jekyll site.</p>

<p>I found this tutorial really helpful, and thatâ€™s how I built the site that youâ€™re visiting now.</p>

<p>Before using Jekyll, I had to copy and paste the header and footer to each and every webpage. Then I learned from W3Schools the server-side include technique. With Jekyll, the efficiency has been improved to another level. I didnâ€™t feel like I used any Ruby or a lot of command lines when building this site, so if youâ€™re also building a static website or blog, I highly recommend checking Jekyll and this resource out!</p>

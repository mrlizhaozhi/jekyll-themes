I"³<p>Finally! Iâ€™ve gotten XAMPP to run on my laptop. Iâ€™ve also installed WordPress via Bitnami. Thisâ€™s the first time I build dynamic websites locally. XAMPP is designed for this purpose and is recommended by many professional developers. 
<br /><br />
In the next few weeks, I plan to explore this software program, learn to use it to develop database-driven websites locally, and use it to learn WordPress development. With XAMPP, Iâ€™m enabled to learn web development and relational database modelling at the same time.
<br /><br />
While setting up a local environment can take a lot more work, it worths the time and effort because it is much safer to develop software components locally before deploying them in the final product. This is an industrial standard. It is a good practice that every professional should pursue. In doing so, it is less likely to create errors and troubles for site visitors and users.
<br /><br />
Thereâ€™re indeed many ways to use WordPress in web development. I can download a starter template and edit the site from there or starting from scratch. My current website hosted on GitHub Pages is static, meaning that I have to manually create, publish, and edit each page not only the posts but also the design, which includes the images, colours, and layouts. My goal is to transform my static website into a MySQL-backed dynamic WordPress website. By incorporating WordPress, I can automate the repetitive steps in web editing and use the CMS to maintain my website more efficiently.
<br /><br />
Let me be clear: my career goal remains the same - I want to be a business analyst or a data scientist but not a web developer or a software engineer. I will learn XAMPP and WordPress as my hobby. I only learn web technologies to build my personal websites. MySQL, on the other hand, is closely aligned with the careers that I want. Therefore, I will also leverage XAMPP and WordPress to develop my SQL and relational modelling skills.
<br /><br />
As I continue to explore these software tools, I will post more to my website. Perhaps, I will rent a custom domain to host my website after incorporating the WordPress CMS. Please check my website regularly for updates.

I"í<p>In the next few hours, I will be making a critical decision that will reshape my career.</p>

<p>After two rounds of interview, Iâ€™ve been offered a job at Procter &amp; Gambleâ€™s IT depertment. However, the role offered isnâ€™t the one that Iâ€™ve been aspiring to. Therefore, this decision merits a careful evaluation.</p>

<p>If I decide to pass this offer, I will stay at HSBC as a Global Operations Graduate Trainee; if I accept this offer, I will leave HSBC and kick off a new career as an IT manager at Procter &amp; Gamble in the fast moving consumer goods industry.</p>

<p>I must thoroughly review and plan my career and think deep in terms of why I took up the job at HSBC and why I should or shouldnâ€™t take the P&amp;G offer.</p>

<p>I spent the past five days celeberating the 73rd anniversary of the People’s Republic of China. I call China home, and as an ordinary middle-class citizen, I want nothing more than a prosperous China that serves its people.</p>

<p>Today I concluded the family reunion trip to Guilin. Guilin is a beautiful tourist destination that I call it my second hometown because most of my relatives reside there. It’s a city filled with hard-working Zhuang Chinese citizens who welcome tourists across China and around the world.</p>

<p>Whilst access to some of the most popular websites and applications has been blocked within the borders of the PRC, I managed to use a VPN to connect to these platforms and share beautiful photos shot on the trip in Guilin. These photos, made by a citizen of China, speaks with higher volume in patriotism and ingenuity than propagandist posts made by government officials. Indeed, I succeeded in catching the attention of numerous foreigners.</p>

<p>Today; however, the VPN applications that once worked failed to connect me to these platforms where I was able to share with the world the good side of China. The connection hasn’t been restored at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>Long before writing this article, I’ve indicated in another blog post in which I pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party’s censorship of free speech and information on the Internet and elsewhere is hindering Chinese businesses. Now this implication has expended to cover ordinary citizens and the positive image of the country on the world stage.</p>

<p>This censorship machine serves no one but the CCP’s leadership, not even CCP members at lower levels. This censorship has one overarching purpose – sustaining the CCP’s grip on power and the Communist ideology. Today’s disconnection from global platforms signals a clear escalation in the CCP’s effort to deprive Chinese people the access to information.</p>

<p>I have faith in the Chinese people. I believe they’re adults and professionals like me who are capable of determining which pieces of information are authentic and which are not. This determination should be made by each individual not by the CCP in line with its dictated, narrowed definition of collective interests.</p>

<p>I will continue to fight against these unjust restrictions on free speech and information with technical capabilities that will help deliver some open-source projects to realise a free and open internet in China and my artistic capabilities which will deliver clear and strong messages to the people of China and the Chinese leader that censorship is wrong and freedom worth fighting.</p>

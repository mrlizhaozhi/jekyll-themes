I"ø<p>The great ancient philosopher Aristotle once said to develop virtues, we must habituate good behaviours through repetition. It takes the same amount of effort to habituate time management â€“ an important virtue that everyone should pursue to build a more productive life.
<br /><br />
Time management is necessary but not an easy task. It does not come naturally to most people, and that is why we need to habituate it â€“ make it a habit with willpower. Luckily, time management is acquirable through habituation, and many people have succeeded in habituating time management. 
<br /><br />
Most people waste time on trivial things such as YouTube videos and computer games not because they fail to recognise the importance of time management, but they lack the framework and willpower to transform their lifestyle. 
<br /><br />
While I still have a long journey before I can effectively manage my time, I have made visible progress in the past few weeks. I started using Excel to plan my day before acting. Planning is a good virtue, and I have habituated it through repetition. It does not matter whether I can successfully deliver my plans on this stage. More importantly, I have proved to myself that I can habituate time management.
<br /><br />
Moving on to the next stage in the habituation of time management, I plan to incorporate the Pomodoro technique to execute my plans. Without actions, plans are useless; therefore, I must translate my plans into action. This is a challenge but also an opportunity for me. If I can effectively manage my time, I can do many more meaningful things.
<br /><br />
As I fight distractions and short-term gains, I will continue to innovate solutions to habituate time management and share my progress on my website.

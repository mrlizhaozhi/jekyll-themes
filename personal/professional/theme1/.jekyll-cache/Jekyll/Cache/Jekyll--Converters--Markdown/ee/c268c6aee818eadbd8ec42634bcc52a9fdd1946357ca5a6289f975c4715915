I"a<p>Today’s the Labour Day of 2022. I wish all who have a job a happy Labour Day and those who’re looking for jobs find success in their search.</p>

<p>Labour Day is when we celebrate hard-working people. We deserve this break because we contribute to society with our intelligence, action, and passions.</p>

<p>On this occasion, I’m also unveiling a new tool to facilitate learning and development. This tool prioritises knowledge and skills that are most relevant to work - that are most needed at this moment.</p>

<p>I’ve determined that working as a Business Analyst, I need to work with complex data to retrieve insights. This requires understanding of business, mathematics, and statistics as well as computing technologies such as Python, R, SQL, and VBA. I also need understanding of data cleansing, visualisation, and modelling tools such as Alteryx Designer, OpenRefine, Power BI, Tableau Desktop, and Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p>Later today, I will issue a detailed plan to approach these learning priorities. I must act now to plan and act to achieve these critical strategic objectives and goals.</p>

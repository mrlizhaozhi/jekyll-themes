Today, I'm introducing the Internet Security Entity List (ISEL) to safteguard privacy and sensitive personal data online. ISEL is a 
tool for identifying and prohibiting the use of software applications that are deemed harmful to privacy and security.

All software applications added to the ISEL must be immediately deleted from personal devices. Acccess and use of these services
on any device is prohibited.

By creating this entity list, I can secure my privacy and data and warn others the potential risks associated with certain software
applications.

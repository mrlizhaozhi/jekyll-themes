I"<p>A few days ago, I decided to delete my YouTube channel and go private. I’ve done this before. Last year, I wanted to be a YouTuber but was undecisive about what topics to cover, so I deleted my channel and everything went normal. At the beginning of this year, I wanted to build a channel to share my video collections on data science, artificial intelligence, and web development. Then, I decided that it is better to share these resources on this website because YouTube isn’t the only source of learning resources. This time when I deleted my channel, I ran into a serious issue – I was deprived of access to YouTube using my Google account!</p>

<p>Since its launch in the last decade, YouTube has grown rapidly worldwide into a global video sharing platform. Users can log in with their Google accounts to search, view, share, and upload videos and engage in online discussion forums. Professionals, amateurs all come to YouTube to create and share their content. Needless to say, YouTube has become a new necessity in the digital age (outside Mainland China).</p>

<p>After removing my channel, I was denied access to YouTube with the following error page (https://www.youtube.com/oops/):</p>

<p><img src="/img/youtube-error.png" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<light style="text-align: center;">YouTube redirects me to this error page. It's been several days.</light>

<p>I was shocked by deleting my channel with zero original work, I’m completely blocked out from the service like never before. So I searched online for solutions. I checked Google and YouTube’s official help forums, Q and A platforms such as Quora, and discussion forums including Reddit, but got no luck. This situation is annoying. I also find it surprising that there is no (convenient) way to contact support either through phone call, live chat, or email given that YouTube and Google are large, reputable internet companies based in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>No matter what I do in YouTube’s help centre, I always get redirected to the homepage of the community. I see countless users complaining about this issue since two or three years ago. Most threads have more than 10 replies – all from users and none from YouTube’s support team.</p>

<p>Make no mistake: YouTube is a successful product. It’s great. It even added a dark theme some months ago, and I’ve been using YouTube since travelling to the United States four years ago. However, from this event, I can only disappointedly conclude that YouTube has an awesome product and horrible after-sales support. The fact that it isn’t even possible to get human assistance in a serious event like this illustrates that YouTube is lackluster in customer support and engagement.</p>

<p>I had similar problems with Autodesk’s account before. It was close to the Christmas of 2022 last year, but still Autodesk managed to have three representatitives connect with me and diagnose my issues through live chat and email until I fixed the problems. This sharp contrast shows how horrible YouTube is to its loyal customers.</p>

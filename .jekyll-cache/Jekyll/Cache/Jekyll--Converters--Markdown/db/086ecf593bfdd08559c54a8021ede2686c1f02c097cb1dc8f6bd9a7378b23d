I"›<p>Stack Overflow is the worldâ€™s most popular developer community that enables developers worldwide to exchange ideas and find out creative solutions to some of the most widely shared tough challenges in the software engineering world collectively.</p>

<p>The platform has done a great job attracting computer talents to share and engage in this virtual community. Itâ€™s many features make code sharing easy. However, not every feature the service offers is good to have. One such example is the downvote button.</p>

<p>When your solution gets upvoted, you earn reputation points. When youâ€™re downvoted on any solution; however, you lose reputation points on your entire profile. This penalty discourages the exchange of ideas and the spirit of helping.</p>

<p>By removing the downvote feature, Stack Overflow can become an even more inclusive and vibrant community for global developers to share and exchange.</p>

I"ó<p>I have made some changes to the <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page with additions of new resources on data 
science and artificial intelligence. I believe all people can benefit from the sharing of resources.
This is why I created this web page on the website.</p>

<p>I collect resources all over the internet. These resources include developer tools, training courses, 
publications (articles, blogs, papers, and books), and videos, etc. These resources facilitate knowledge
sharing and advancement in scientific research.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I will continue to add resources to that page. Iâ€™m considering modernisation of the web
page with new sections focus on web development, software engineering, and careers. Please stay tunned!</p>

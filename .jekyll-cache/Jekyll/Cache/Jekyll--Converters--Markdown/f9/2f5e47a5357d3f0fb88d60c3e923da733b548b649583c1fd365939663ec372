I"ý<p>Today is a very important day for me. I will be joining my future colleagues at HSBC later this afternoon and continuing my preparation for the driver license exam scheduled to take place tomorrow afternoon. These are both important events on my calendar.
<br /><br />
The afternoon meeting will be the second event that I attend since joining HSBC. This is another opportunity to expand my professional network across Global Operations and the wider HSBC Group. I will attend this meeting prepared with questions. I will connect with people on LinkedIn and seize this opportunity to learn more about the programme, the organisation, and my duties.
<br /><br />
I will devote the rest of my day to driver license exam practice. This is my second attempt, so I must be well prepared and pass the exam. The exam really isnâ€™t too bad. Many less educated people have managed to pass the exam. I see no reason to fail twice. I will use my time wisely to complete all the exercise problems on the mobile application and complete at least three mock tests before taking the real exam next day. I aim to achieve a score of above 95 out of 100 on each attempt.
<br /><br />
I will share more after the afternoon meeting and at the end of the day on these two important events.</p>

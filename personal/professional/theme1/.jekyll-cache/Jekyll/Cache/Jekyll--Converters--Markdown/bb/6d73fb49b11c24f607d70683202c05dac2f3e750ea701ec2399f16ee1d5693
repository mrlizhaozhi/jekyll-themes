I"<p>I will start a studio to make animated films and series, develop interactive games, publish comics, magazines and videos and operate digital media. The studio will grow into a multinational media and entertainment business listed in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>To make all these happen, I will start as an independent filmmaker. I will learn to animate and produce animated films and series with captivating stories. These films will be 8 to 10 minutes long, and there will be no sequel. I plan to make 5 films and 2 series. Each series will include 10 episodes, each last less than 5 minutes. These episodes will be independent stories with the same set of characters. All these work will be published on Bilibili, YouTube and other video streaming services.</p>

<p>I will follow the process of making theatre-grade films. I will brainstorm, design, storyboard and animate. All these will be published on the official website of the studio. I will build a website for each film and show created under the studio brand. I will create games on these websites to recreate the experience in the films and shows and operate social media to promote products and drive engagement.</p>

<p>The business model is simple. I will profit from fan donation, advertising sales, branded consumer goods and IP licensing.</p>

I"Ø<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about how I can make this website more useful for visitors since the launch of the site at the beginning of this year. I want to present my knowledge, demonstrate what I am capable of by building this site from scratch and featuring some projects that I completed before, and those that Iâ€™m currently working on. This website also has a blog section where I post my thoughts on a broad range of topics from web development, data science, to artificial intelligence. I hope to share my thoughts and learning experience so that others can benefit from these sharings.</p>

<p>As a static website, it becomes more and more challenging to maintain as the number of pages grows. This site is hosted freely at Bitbucket.io, a similar code hosting service to GitHub. When the site was launched, I only had one blog. All the posts that I publish are shown in the same section. Whilst I incorporated post tags and a static search tool to help visitors navigate through the content, itâ€™s still hard to find information because I have 10 pages of posts on different topics. I thought having several blogs each concentrates on a single topic would make it easy for readers to find content. However, this is quite difficult considering the limited functionality of static websites.</p>

<p>To make it easy for me to edit the content on the website, I used Jekyll to build this site. Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby, created by GitHub. It can generate HTML pages from markdown files based on pre-designed custom templates to create static websites. It has a robust open-source community comprising of developers from around the globe. Developers collaborate on and release value-added features to help Jekyllers (people who build with Jekyll) to achieve more with the tool. Whilst Iâ€™ve never learned â€“ not even heard of â€“ Ruby prior to meeting Jekyll, Iâ€™ve been able to get the hing of it painlessly. Iâ€™ve been doing extensive research on Jekyll as I continue to scale the website. I came across a great pagination tool (Ruby gem) called jekyll-paginate-v2. Many Jekyll related gems have Jekyll in their names. jekyll-paginate-v2 is an upgraded version of jekyll-paginate. When I built the first blog, I used jekyll-paginate, which only works in index.html files and supports just one page. Because of that, I wasnâ€™t able to realize my design ambition of having multiple concentrated blogs on the same website.</p>

<p>Unlike jekyll-paginate, jekyll-paginate-v2 is capable of much more: it supports not only index files but other files as well. It allows multiple blogs on the same website â€“ exactly the same feature that Iâ€™ve been craving for. And, it allows developers to filter blog posts by tags and categories. Since I tagged all my posts, so it is fairly easy for me to build multiple concentrated blogs by filtering tags. This is how I have four blogs on this website!</p>

<p>Check out my main blog where I post random stuff and everything from the concentrated blogs at <a href="/blogs/">https://mrlizhaozhi.bitbucket.io/blogs/</a>, my web development blog at <a href="/blogs/web-development/">https://mrlizhaozhi.bitbucket.io/blogs/web-development/</a>, my data science blog at <a href="/blogs/data-science/">https://mrlizhaozhi.bitbucket.io/blogs/data-science/</a> and my artificial intelligence blog at <a href="/blogs/artificial-intelligence/">https://mrlizhaozhi.bitbucket.io/blogs/artificial-intelligence</a>.</p>

<p>I will talk more about each of these blogs in other posts.</p>

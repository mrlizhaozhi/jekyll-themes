I"W<p>Yesterday, YouTube has restored my access to its services after a 10-day wait.</p>

<p>Whilst I’m relieved for the restoration, I’m still disappointed at how YouTube, such a huge company and widely used service, can take this long to delete a channel without original uploads, barring users from accessing its services, and offering no channel to contact customer support. Many users like me were left alone puzzled and strugging.</p>

<p>As analysed in my previous post, I hope that YouTube will consider these advice. With Google’s strong AI capabilities, YouTube should be able to implement the steps outlined in my analysis.</p>

<p>This yet again illustrates the urgency of supporting Made in China so that we have more control over our digital and physical assets and the interests and rights that we have as individuals and consumers.</p>

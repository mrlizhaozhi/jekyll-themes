I"ï<p>Yesterday (5 November 2022), Meta‚Äôs Facebook imposed yet another arbitrary restriction on my account, depriving me of access to the Meta Business account‚Äôs advertising features for vague ‚Äúviolation‚Äù of its rules.</p>

<p>I have never used my Facebook account to advertise anything. This restriction came as a surprise and insult. This is not the first time I open a Facebook account. I opened one years ago to connect with overseas friends. That account was disabled permanently by Meta after it arbitrarily restricted me from accessing the account and attempted to force me to submit photo ID. Of course, I rejected that request to protect personal data.</p>

<p>Meta products are not transparent enough with their community rule enforcement. I‚Äôve seen repeatedly people complain about their accounts being wrongfully restricted by Meta‚Äôs automated system or human curators.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt the first account I open with Facebook. Since the email address associated with the disabled Facebook account has been blocked by the system, I opened an email account just to sign up for this account to participate in Facebook group discussions to share artwork and explore trends in Big Data and AI.</p>

<p>I left the platform precisely because of its arbitrary enforcement of opaque community rules, and I won‚Äôt hesitate to delete this account should Meta further invade my interests and rights on the service.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I found a potential alternative - Discord. Discord is a global platform just like Facebook that has communities built around a broad range of subjects. I will delete the account should Facebook continues this act of aggression.</p>

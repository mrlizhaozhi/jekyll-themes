I"h	<p>I’ve been working on quite a few projects in web development and data science. These projects are designed to sharpen my skills. Last week, I also released the first edition of the List of Critical Skills for Career Development which identifies a list of skills that I need to master to succeed in my career.</p>

<p>I’ve been learning WordPress and Jekyll theme development. WordPress is a popular open-source content management system for dynamic websites, and Jekyll is a static site generator from GitHub. These tools are widely used in the Web industry. I must acquire them to form a solid foundation for further advancement in this field. Whilst I’ve made good progress in Jekyll development, I haven’t done so much on WordPress. Hence, WordPress will be my focus this week.</p>

<p>I’m also writing a book on Python for data science. This’s the first time I write a book. It’s a technical book that teaches beginner data scientists Python programming and its application in data analysis. This will be an e-book. I plan to publish the book on my website and leanpub.com after finishing three chapters.</p>

<p>Moving on to the List of Critical Skills. In addition to the listed skills on the List, I’ve determined that a few other skills should be added to the list.</p>

<p>Django and Flask and Vue are also required skills for me to thrive in web development. Python’s capabilities in data analysis combined with the growing awareness of the value of data, it is predicted that Python will dominate the Web soon. Django and Flask will help me build web applications with Python. Vue is a simplified version of Angular. It’s the first widely adopted open-source framework from China. To support my country, I should devote time to acquiring Vue development skills.</p>

<p>I’ve also determined that R and its data science packages including but not limited to tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, and caret, etc. should also be added to the List. R is specifically designed for statistical programming. While it is not as popular and capable as Python, it still worth learning.</p>

<p>In addition, I’ve also designated project management and networking a critical skills for career development. These new categories will be added to the List as well. All the additions to the List announced in this post will take effect when the refreshed List being published on this website.</p>

I"><p>On 1st February 2022, the United States Department of Homeland Security launched a new official site - <a href="www.dhs.gov">DHS.gov</a>. Prior to the official launch, the new site was made accessible at https://preview.dhs.gov/ for preview. I was one of the site’s first visitors who left feedback on the website. In this post, I will review the website from a professional web developer’s standpoint. Click <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/02/01/announcing-launch-new-dhsgov/">here</a> for the official announcement.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a>, you can see the evolution of DHS.gov. By comparing the design of the current website and the last version, we can see the overall appearance has undergone a significant improvement. The new theme looks a lot cleaner than the previous version, which is a good thing.</p>

<p>Just like the previous version of DHS.gov, the new website is a multiple-page website instead of a single-page website. MPAs are known for their advantages in search engine optimisation (SEO). They’re well suited for government uses.</p>

<p>Unlike the old DHS.gov, the new website lists policy issues using cards instead of a carousel, making it easier to find and access different pages. Carousels were a fashion in the early age of web development. Many major websites adopted carousels to display as much information as possible on the front page and other pages, but this is no longer the case. Web designers now prefer a static hero image over a changing one.</p>

<p>Whilst the design has been improved significantly, there’re a few accessibility and compatibility flaws on the newly launched website. These flaws have undermined the overall user experience on the website.</p>

<p>One of the accessibility flaws is identified on biographies pages. Take a look at the following example: When the page is displayed on a mobile device, the text will be squeezed into the upper left corner next to the profile image, making it difficult to read the text.</p>

<p><img src="/img/dhs-gov-screenshot-3.png" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

<p>A better way to display the text and image is to make the image full screen on mobile devices and all texts shown below the image.</p>

<p>Another accessibility flaw belongs to the mobile nagivation bar. As can be seen from the following screenshot, the new site uses a side bar with accordions to display navigation menu. On a small screen, it’s pretty hard to read texts smashed into the right side. A better way to do this, I think, is to make the nagivation menu full screen.</p>

<p>Finally, a significant compatibility issue is identified in Internet Explorer 11. In general, the United States government follows the 2% rule, meaning that all browsers with more than 2% traffic should be condsidered when building accessible public digital services. The Department’s previous website was compatible with IE so should the new website.</p>

<p>Whilst Microsoft announced the official retirement of IE in 2021, the browser is still used at homes and in offices across the globe. The browser has not yet gone into history. As shown in the following screenshots, the updated DHS.gov is completely not compatible with IE and perhaps other Tident-based web browsers as well.</p>

<img src="/img/dhs-gov-screenshot-6.png" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

<p>These are the design problems I observed from the new DHS.gov so far. As the Department continues its web modernisation efforts, there surely will be more updates made to the site.</p>

<p>I will continue to visit the site and discuss user experience issues in blog posts. I will expand this product review article series to include other products and services as well, including but not limited to web-based and mobile application, electronic devices and others.</p>

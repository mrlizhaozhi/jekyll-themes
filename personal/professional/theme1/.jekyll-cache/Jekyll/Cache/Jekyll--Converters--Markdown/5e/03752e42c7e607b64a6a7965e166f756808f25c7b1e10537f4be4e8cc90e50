I"´<p>Today, Iâ€™m creating a new tool to help improve grammar in English writing. Like other Chinese students, I went through a comprehensive English education since in primary school, but Iâ€™m still repeating some grammatical errors in writing. Proper grammar is critical in effective communication. Bad grammar discredits the content of writing. This tool will help me move one step closer to better English grammar.</p>

<p>Starting today, right at this moment with this article, I will build a grammar reference list to record and correct the mistakes I make in writing. This list will help me see where I am falling short in terms of grammar. I will then keep those in mind and try not to repeat the same mistakes twice or even multiple times. I will as well refer to resources such as grammar books and exercises to focus on the areas of improvement, doing exercises to improve those until I can identify and avoid the errors completely.</p>

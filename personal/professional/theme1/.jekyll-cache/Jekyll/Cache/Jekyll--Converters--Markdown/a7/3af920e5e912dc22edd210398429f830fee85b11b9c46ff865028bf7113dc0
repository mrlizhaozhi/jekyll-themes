I"	<p>Microsoft Excel remains the most popular spreadsheet software in the market. It is more powerful than many people could think of. It isn’t just a software for documenting information, performing calculations or making some basic charts. It can be used to build dynamic financial models and user form applications - with the help of VBA of course. VBA is a programming language designed for Excel and other Microsoft programs. You can actually write code in Excel to automate tasks. 
<br /><br />
While you can’t build powerful applications such as Facebook and Photoshop with Excel, Excel-based applications are extremely useful in operations management. There’re a few reasons. First, while your company may not have purchased more sophisticated application development toolkit like Visual Studio, you’re very likely to have Excel with other Microsoft Office Suite software programs pre-installed on your corporate laptop. As I said before, Excel is the most popular spreadsheet software in the world, and I don’t see any other product has the power to challenge its position in the market. Second, Excel looks much more intuitive than other development tools. It is a spreadsheet software made up of rows and columns. Unlike Visual Studio and Eclipse, you don’t need to work hard to set up an environment before you can get work done. Third, Excel applications can run on all Excel programs as long as you enable the Macros. You can also use Macros to write VBA code without having to write the code line by line yourself.
<br /><br />
How do Excel applications fit into operations management? You can use it to build interactive dashboards to assess risks and benefits of each project you plan to proceed with, you can build tracking systems to standardise the workflow so that all employees are following a fixed set of steps or maybe use it to build some smart tools to enter data into existing systems, etc. 
<br /><br />
In the next two days, I will learn to build some smart tools with Excel and VBA to build a tracking system to make sure my fellow colleagues to follow a standard operating procedure. This’s based on a real business case, but I will use fictional data to comply with corporate policy. Please stay tuned and check my website later for this case study.

I"<p>I love web development. This love is intrinsic. Since I learned web application development at university, I have fallen in love with the Web. I’ve built a number of websites including a commercial website for a client based in Atherton, CA during the summer of 2020. 
<br /><br />
Through these projects, I’ve learned the basics of web application development. I’ve moved from relying on pre-built frameworks to designing and building an entire fully-functional website from scratch. However, this’s time to change the way I learn web development. Whilst I’ve successfully launched a couple of websites, I’ve been sticking with the old technologies that I’m alreay familiar with. I haven’t made much visible progress in terms of cross-browser compatibility, more sophisticated JavaScript programs, back-end development and responsive layout, etc. 
<br /><br />
It’s time to change. It’s time to adopt a more focused approach to learning web application development rather than measuring progress by quantity only. I should focus on the areas of improvement, namely compatibility, responsive layout, JavaScript programming and back-end development. It’s time to act and time to pause and think carefully how I can make the most out of each practice.

I"…<p>Web development has become one of the few things that get me excited. The other two are data science and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Since the web-based applications course opened me the door to the world of web development in the third year of college, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by the many opportunities that this world presents.</p>

<p>Todayâ€™s world is more digitised than ever before. Most if not all successful individuals, businesses, organisations and governments run on data and are building presence in the digital world. After all, looking up information online has become an intuition of many people.</p>

<p>After discovering that BitBucket can help me host static websites and blogs that are globally accessible, I decided to return to web development at the beginning of this year. I learned to build and deploy static websites with Jekyll, the popular static site generator, and made one of the templates that I designed last year accessible in all mainstream browsers, including the notorious Internet Explorer 11.</p>

<p>Whilst I maintain the position that I wonâ€™t be a full-time web developer because I truly believe that Iâ€™m destined for something far more significant; undeniably, web development has become a part of me. I really enjoy designing stunning web applications, and I should let this passion guide me through the world of the Web.</p>

<p>After much consideration, I have decided to further strengthen my coding skills by encouraging myself to take on more creative and challenging projects. Now, I can build blog sites, but web development can bring something much more practical and sophisticated.</p>

<p>I will design a programme to help me systematically acquire the knowledge and tools of web development so that Iâ€™m equipped to build better, more useful and accessible web-based products and services. Perhaps, this can lead me to my very first business opportunity.</p>

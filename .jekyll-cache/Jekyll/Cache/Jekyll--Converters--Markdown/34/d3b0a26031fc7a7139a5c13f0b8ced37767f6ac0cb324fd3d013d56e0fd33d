I"ÿ<p>The Art and Design Studios (ADS) at the Office of Li Zhaozhi has launched Instagram and Facebook accounts to 
engage with audiences.</p>

<p>Instagram and Facebook are both Meta Platforms, Inc. products. These social media platforms are used globally
except for a few countries. These platforms are good for sharing texts, images, and videos, etc., making them
ideal for ADS to promote its projects including comics, animation, and others.</p>

<p>I created an Instagram and Facebook account two years ago, but those were disabled by Meta for ‚Äúviolating‚Äù its
opaque community rules. At the time of this announcement, those accounts remain inaccessible. Hence, the ADS 
had to create new Instagram and Facebook accounts.</p>

<p>Beginning August 6, 2022, these accounts will be accessible on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lzzstudio">https://www.instagram.com/lzzstudio</a>
and on Facebook at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lzzstudio">https://wwww.facebook.com/lzzstudio</a>. If I succeed in 
regaining control of those disabled accounts, please expect a migration of contents. I will start posting drawings,
animation, and other content on these platforms beginning August 2022.</p>

<p>Please subscribe to these channels and stay tunned for updates! In addition to Instagram and Facebook, I‚Äôm considering
creating profiles on other social media and video streaming platforms such as Twitter and
YouTube as well as platforms facing the mainland Chinese audience.</p>

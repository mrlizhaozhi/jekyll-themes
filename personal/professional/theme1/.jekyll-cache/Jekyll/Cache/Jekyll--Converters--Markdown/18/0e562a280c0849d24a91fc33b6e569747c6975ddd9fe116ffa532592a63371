I"µ<p>The free flow of information is critical to our society. We depend on valuable information for decision making in every aspect of our life from home, school to work, etc. I want to contribute to this flow of information to get help for those whoâ€™re in desperate need. Thisâ€™s why I built my own website and became a blogger. Today, Iâ€™m not going to discuss information sharing; rather, Iâ€™d like to talk about the critical balance between the sharing and security of information on the internet.
<br /><br />
As previously disclosed, Iâ€™m now an HSBC employee. Iâ€™m a management trainee whoâ€™s participating in the global bankâ€™s graduate scheme. This scheme is designed to produce senior executives. The financial services industry relies on information access and security. HSBC takes security seriously because failure in securing data entrusted with the bank can result in immeasurable financial and reputational damages as well as legal consequences. As a management trainee of HSBC, I need to take up the responsibility of securing information on the job and after work. I must comply with company policies regarding data security. As a blogger, I must constantly remind myself of my profession and be cautious when discussing any topic related to my work at HSBC.<br />
<br /><br />
Moving forward, I will be particularly mindful when I mention HSBC in my blog posts. I will avoid making references to my employer where possible and focus on my stories instead of where these stories happened. It has become increasingly challenging to maintain the critical balance between information access and security. However, I will do my part, and thisâ€™s all I can do as an individual.

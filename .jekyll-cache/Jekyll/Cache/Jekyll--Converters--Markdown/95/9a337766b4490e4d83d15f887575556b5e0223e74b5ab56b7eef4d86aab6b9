I"À<p>I just made an irreversable decision which I hope that I wonâ€™t regret. I decided to permanently delete all other themes I designed for good. This means, I will stick with the current web design a bit longer before this website switches with a new look.</p>

<p>I made this decision because I couldnâ€™t control my impulse to jump between themes. As discussed in a post published last year, it is now better for me to stick around one theme and work to make it perfect than switching between themes constantly to strengthen my web development skills. Now itâ€™s more practical for me to complete the announced full-stack design system than building just another website theme.</p>

<p>By deleting other unused themes, Iâ€™m killing this impulse of moving around. This helps me focus on improving the current theme and put more time and effort in completing the development of the design system. An open-source full-stack design system is way more valuable and practical for fellow developers than pre-built themes that are sometimes difficult to modify and debug.</p>

<p>Now with all those themes retired, I will focus 100% on improving the current theme and finish building the long-awaited design system.</p>

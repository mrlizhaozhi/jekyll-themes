I"š<p>Iâ€™m using mind maps and review documents to analyse my resume. These will help prepare for interviews and other job seeking activities. If this strategy is proven successful, I will make another post explain in detail how this technique works.</p>

<p>A mind map is a visual representation of ideas. Itâ€™s a great trick for recalling memory of project and work experiences, which will be immensely helpful for interview Q&amp;As.</p>

<p>A review document is a document that lists key concepts covered in each experience on resume. This is a good way to consolidate, summarize and review the knowledge points that can appear in an interview.</p>

<p>Finally, Iâ€™ve also created outlines containing key points to be covered to answer some of the most classic questions.</p>

<p>Together, these tools will help prepare for interviews by analysing resumes in great detail. For more information, please stay tuned.</p>

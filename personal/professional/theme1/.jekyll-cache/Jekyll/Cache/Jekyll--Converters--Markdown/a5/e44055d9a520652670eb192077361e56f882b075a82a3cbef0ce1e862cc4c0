I"	<p>Today, I’m excited to share that I have secured my second commercial web project. Since building that council campaign website for the Californian client in the summer of 2020, I’ve been sharpening my development skills. This new opportunity will allow me to apply what I’ve learned in the past year and extend my professional experience further.</p>

<p>Unlike the campaign website, this will be a complex system on which users from three different categories can sign up for accounts and interact with the app to fit their needs. It will be a dynamic web application that runs on a relational database. It will involve analytics on the back end. It will also need a graphical user interface that enables users to edit content from the database. I can tell, this will be another challenge and rewarding learning experience.</p>

<p>Whilst WordPress is great for content management for dynamic applications, I may need to build everything from scratch for this project due to its complexity. This will be an opportunity to develop and apply the design system that I announced earlier.</p>

<p>In the coming days, I will schedule a few meetings with stakeholders to finalise some details, create a wireframe or mockup for the application and start building the app from there.</p>

message: "Resources supporting learning and development."
description: "I collect serial articles, forum posts, videos, courses, journal articles, and books from a variety of sources such as the internet and peer-reviewed publications to aid my study plans. I believe identifying and promoting useful resources are helpful for the global community. This is exactly the reason why I decided to create this page on my website to share the resources that I find useful. This is also a place for me to revisit some of the resources for fulfiling future needs.

                I am a data scientist with Linkedin's Data Science and Applied Research (DSAR) team. I earned my 
                PhD in Statistics at Stanford in 2021, advised by Rob Tibshirani. I am interested in all things 
                statistics, but especially in developing statistical software, understanding how statistical 
                analyses can impact decision-making more effectively, as well as how statistics is communicated to 
                the public and in the classroom.

                The goal of this blog is to give you some tools to help you approach math problems in a systematic 
                manner. We will do this by example. Each blog post will consist of one (or more) math olympiad 
                problems, followed by my train of thought in working out the solution. The problems in this blog 
                will range in difficulty but will generally come from competitions for grades 10-12.

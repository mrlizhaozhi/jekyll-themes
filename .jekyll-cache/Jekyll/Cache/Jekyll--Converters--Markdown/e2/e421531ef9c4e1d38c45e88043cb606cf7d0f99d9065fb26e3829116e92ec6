I"<p>This website is undergoing a lot of changes lately. I’m making these changes to make this website more accessible and the information presented more useful.</p>

<p>The revamped About, Issues, and Research sections and the newly created Art and Design Studio section are now more accessible and informative than ever before. I have also improved the website’s accessibility support for Microsoft’s retired Internet Explorer 11 browser.</p>

<p>All these efforts are aiming at building a better website accessible to the widest possible audience. These changes also reflect my ambitions in career development, data analytics, science and technology and art and design.</p>

<p>I strive to be a mission-oriented, value-driven person. So I renovated the About section to highlight my mission, values and strategy. As the acquisition of STEM skills becomes more important, I updated the Research section to focus my efforts on web development, data science and artificial intelligence. These technologies will have a great impact on my career. I have as well edited the Issues section to divide it up into Careers, Growth, Networking, and Others. I believe it’s critical to understand where I’m falling short and concentrate on solving these issues. Finally, I launched the Art and Design Studio to produce comics, fictions, and animation. I believe art and design are a source of strength in times of uncertainty and depression.</p>

<p>As I continue to update the website, I will publish more useful information. I’m in the process of finishing up About, Issues, and Research sections and renovating the blogs section. I plan to draw a clearer boundry between news and blogs. And there will be a new section where downloadable materials such as documents, audios, videos, and images will be provided. I’m also maintaining resources in other languages. I’m updating the Chinese and Spanish pages so that visitors speaking these two languages can have access to the content of the site as well. More changes to come. Stay tunned!</p>

	<h1>Why is a free and open Internet important?</h1>
	
	<p>
		The Internet serves as the foundation of the modern digital economy. People live on the Internet as well. Just count how many websites and 
		applications you have accessed since the moment you wake up till the moment you lay down. I believe almost no modern citizen can claim that
		he has used none.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Internet needs to be free and open. It is an infrastructure, a platform, but not the content generator or service provider. Keeping this
		platform free and open encourages inclusion in the development of the digital economy and society. Those who share and use the content are the 
		ones who're in charge of the Internet. Hence, people shall have unhindered access to the Internet, share and consume information and services
		as they please.
	</p>
	<p>
		Simply put, the Internet is a means for sharing knowledge and delivering services for and by the people. It shouldn't be a means that serve the 
		interests of a single participant, whether that is the government, an organisation or an individual. A free and open Internet shall serve the 
		interests of all, from government to citizens whilst a closed and heavily censored Internet does not.
	</p>

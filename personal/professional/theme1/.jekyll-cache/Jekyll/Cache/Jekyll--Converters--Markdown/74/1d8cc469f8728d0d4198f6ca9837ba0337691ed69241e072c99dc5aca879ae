I"}<p>Career development is a complex challenge. The first three years are the most important. As you move far and far away from academia, your experience will be the primary basis on which companies determine what roles you can fit. Hence, it’s critical to start right - get into the field and role that you want to secure a prosperous future.</p>

<p>Career goals should be shaped by your passions, not titles, employers, or others. When you’re interested in your work, you’re more likely than not putting more efforts to work out solutions - grow, excel, and advance in your career. When you are happy, you deliver higher quality work. Your client, colleagues, and managers will be pleased as well. Securing the right offer starts with applications.</p>

<p>Concerned by failure, candidates tend to lean in favour of the recruiting company in job applications and screening processes. Oftentimes, they apply for jobs that they lack an adequate level of understanding and craft resumes to fit the job requirements. Whilst this effort may turn out successful in terms of getting employment, it is not the right strategy to build a career that rewards and lasts.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in business intelligence, then you should only apply for roles that are relevant. The SMART model is applicable to career objectives as well. The roles that you sign up for should be relevant to your passions. And, when you craft your resume and application materials, you should always keep this goal in mind, hightlight your accomplishments that demonstrate your qualifications and talk less about the aspects that you don’t look to have in your new role.</p>

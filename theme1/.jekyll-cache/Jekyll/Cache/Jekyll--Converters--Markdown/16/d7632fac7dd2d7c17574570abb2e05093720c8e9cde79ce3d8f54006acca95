I"k<p>Dear readers,</p>

<p>Today, I’m launching an online magazine titled <em>Sketch Notes</em> on <a href="https://thesketchnotes.blogspot.com">https://thesketchnotes.blogspot.com</a>. This magazine will feature themed sketches I make almost every day to share my thoughts on a broad range of topics such as philosophy, politics and others.</p>

<p>This blog is hosted on <a href="https://www.blogger.com">Blogger.com</a>, a Google blogging service. Just like other Google products and services, Blogger.com is blocked in mainland China. Due to this restriction, I plan to publish this magazine mainly in English.</p>

<p>I love reading, blogging and sketching. This magazine will combine all my hobbies and serve as a platform to communicate with the outside world. I believe an image speaks more than 1000 words, so this magazine – as the name suggests – would be “written” in sketches coupled with some short notes.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the content presented here, engage in discussions in the comment section, and visit this website multiple times a week for fresh updates.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Li Zhaozhi</p>

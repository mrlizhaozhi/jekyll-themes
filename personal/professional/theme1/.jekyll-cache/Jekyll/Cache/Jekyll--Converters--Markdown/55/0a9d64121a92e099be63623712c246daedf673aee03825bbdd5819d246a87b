I"³	<p>In a previous post, I highlighted that this website forms part of the wider branding strategy. At the time of this writing, this strategy is under development.</p>

<p>Since I introduced this website in late 2019 following the completion of the web applications course in college, the site has undergone multiple rounds of redesign. This isnâ€™t the first edition, and it wonâ€™t be the last edition.</p>

<p>As I continue to iterate, I introduced new technology into the infrastructure of this website. The first few editions were based on Bootstrap, an open-source framework, and were maintained manually page by page. With this pre-built framework, the design was inflexible in the sense that I had to follow the rules that the authors of Bootstrap set when they built the framework. Since I got to update the content page by page, it involved a huge amount of manual labour and was prone to error.</p>

<p>As I learned new technologies, I incorporated them into the website. Today, this site continues to run on GitHub Pages. It is static but has my personal stamp on it. I abandoned Bootstrap once I learned to build my own responsive design framework. I converted the original site into a Jekyll-supported theme. Jekyll is a framework for generating HTML pages from markdown brought by GitHub. This makes it easier to update and maintain the website. As I continue to roll out the full-stack design system, I will incorporate new technologies into the website in future iterations.</p>

<p>In the next iteration, I should focus on the message that I want to deliver through this website. Itâ€™s clear that this is a personal website. I need to incorporate even more personal elements into the design of the product. Iâ€™ve posted hundreds of posts on the website covering a wide range of topics. Itâ€™s time to narrow down and produce more insightful, thoughtful and meaningful posts that are worth reading. I also need to step up marketing efforts to make this site more visible on search engines and other platforms.</p>

<p>I must take advantage of this website to market my strengths as a professional and individual. This would be great platform for branding if itâ€™s set up and used rightfully. As the first step of these upcoming changes, I will start removing posts and pages from the website that do not meet the new standards. I will gradually turn this website into a more powerful tool of communication with new features added and useless features removed.</p>

<p>Today, I finished watching A Quiet Place Part II. This is one of my favourite horror films. I watched Part I one or two years ago. The fact that I still remember the 
details from the previous film without having to rewatch it shows that A Quiet Place is an excellent series. I encourage everyone to watch it at night with friends and
lights off!
<br /><br />
Part II, just like the previous film, is horrific. After the father sacrificed himself to save the family at the end of Part I, the rest of the family resumed their journey.
Now they have a newborn crying baby. Family remains the biggest element of the film because everything - every decision that the protagonists make is about the family.
This is a very special film - as the title suggests - it is very quiet throughout. Since any noice can trigger alien attacks, it is necessary but not always easy for the 
characters to stay quiet.
<br /><br />
The ending is ‚ÄúOK‚Äù because I feel like something is cut off. However, I hope that the sequel, Part III, will round up everything neatly. I will definitely watch in theatres 
when the third episode come out in 2023!

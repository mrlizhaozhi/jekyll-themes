I"Ü<p>Yesterday, I had a quick chat with a friend who I got to know in a WeChat group. I asked for his opinion on the website I built (The one you‚Äôre now looking at.). A little disappointing but unsurprising, his answer was ‚ÄúIt can be better‚Äù.</p>

<p>In at least three prior posts, I discussed the issues in my approach to learning web application development and highlighted the urgent need to change course. Indeed, the website could be improved, whether it is being more responsive and mobile-first or using a more appropriate layout design and better quality images, there‚Äôre many ways to take this site to the next level.</p>

<p>When he said the site could be enhanced, I was disappointed. I wanted to put another template that I designed last year, which looks a bit better, to replace the current theme. However, I must keep in mind that switching between templates didn‚Äôt get me better at web development. It is one of the reasons I identified to be responsible for my slow progress in acquiring cutting-edge design techniques.</p>

<p>Building a design system is the answer to this urgency, not building another website. I announced in February to introduce a new full-stack development framework. This framework will include a design system that provides guidance and best practices for styling web pages as well as a developer toolkit for easily implementing commonly used web components such as navbars, footers, and carousels so users can focus more on customization and more creative tasks.</p>

<p>Building a design system is a challenge. It will expose me to many kinds of challenges, pushing me to find solutions and think out of the box. It will push me to learn CSS and JavaScript to incorporate more and better techniques. These languages are critical in web development, yet I still have a lot to learn before I can achieve mastery.</p>

<p>In the next couple of days, I will continue to finish my study plan for mastering the basics of web applications through developing this design system. I will leverage this opportunity to review HTML, CSS and JavaScript principles, acquire knowledge and skills in some popular libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, and React, and learn to use CMSs such as Drupal and WordPress. I will also learn to build CSS-JavaScript animation effects to make the Web UI more compelling to visitors. This will as well be an opportunity to learn back-end development using PHP, Python, back-end frameworks and libraries. I will also learn Vue and MasterGo and other Made in China solutions for web application development.</p>

<p>If I want to excel in the Web and application development, I must invest the time and resources necessary. I must strive to be the best in this field through continuous learning and hands-on exercises. I must approach web development methodically through making a study plan. If I can do these, I will become a successful, professional developer.</p>

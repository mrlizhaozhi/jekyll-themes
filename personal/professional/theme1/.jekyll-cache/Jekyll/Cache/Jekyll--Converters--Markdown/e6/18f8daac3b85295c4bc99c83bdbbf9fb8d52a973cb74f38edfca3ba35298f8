I"ä<p>Consensus is growing in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC) that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)â€™s zero-COVID policy must end for the sake of peopleâ€™s life. Multiple tragic incidents, including mistreatment of citizens in lockdown, refusal of offering treatment to pregnant women leading to miscarriage, and delay in rescue because of roadblocks which lead to deaths in fire, are triggering waves of outrage among society.</p>

<p>Under the CCPâ€™s stringent control on the freedoms of information and expression, Chinese citizens are forced to protest online with code words. Itâ€™s sad, tragic and sarcastic that people are unable to express themselves in their own country, at their homes. This repression must end now.</p>

<p>The CCP has a long history of manipulating public opinions through censoring media and the internet. Countless reshares showing doubts of the people on multiple aspects of the zero-COVID policy and tragic events because of government-led lockdown are removed from Weibo and WeChat.</p>

<p>Brave patriots are holding the CCP accountable for its contempt for peopleâ€™s concerns and indifference to human life by using photos, artwork and videos and other unconventional forms of expression to circumenvent the governmentâ€™s censorship, ensuring the peopleâ€™s voices are loud, clear and shared.</p>

<p>A few weeks back, the Office of Li Zhaozhi launched the <a href="/en-uk/free-and-open-internet/">Free and Open Internet</a> Initiative, which has a critical mission of helping people around the world to fairly participate in the development of the Internet, ensuring that the Internet serves the best interests of society and no censorship that serve the powerful will be allowed to take away justice and peopleâ€™s right to access information and express themselves.</p>

<p>This mission must continue in light of these outrageous and egregious acts of the CCP and the fight against wrongful censorship. The people of the PRC and of all countries deserve to be heard.</p>

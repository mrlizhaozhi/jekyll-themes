I"®<p>[FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE]
<br /><br />
Today, Iâ€™m announcing the introduction of a new research website. This website will be dedicated to my research activities. It will be the primary destination for the information of my research programmes and projects.
<br /><br />
Why would I need a dedicated website for research when I already have a research page on my website? I strongly believe in the importance of research. To advance in my career, I must continue to learn. After graduating college, it is all up to me to take the initiative to learn new stuff. A dedicated research website will allow me to track my progress. By making my progress public, I can press myself to learn new things and share my work with others.
<br /><br />
Iâ€™m currently in the process of designing, developing, and publishing this new website. It will replace the current research page and be accessible at https://mrlizhaozhi.github.io/research/. It will operate independently from my current website. I expect to launch this new website before 15 July 2021. 
<br /><br />
I will publish another press release when the website becomes available to the public. Please stay tuned and wait for the release.</p>

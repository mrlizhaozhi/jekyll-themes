<p>I’m serious when I said making web development a lifetime passion. Having now built a number of responsive static websites, it’s time to master the bolts and nuts of frontend design.</p>

<p>Pagination, a traditionally backend feature, is now made possible with static site generators such as Jekyll. This website is hosted on Bitbucket and powered by Jekyll. By now, you should know this entire website, including the paginated blog, is static.</p>

<p>Whilst I managed to make the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-paginate</code> plugin works on this website, I have yet to design a truly responsive pagination for the blog pages. The current pagination will get longer and longer as the number of pages grow. This isn’t a long-term solution for a website that will perhaps have hundreds of pages.</p>

<p>Pagination is certainly an important feature that many modern websites - both static and dynamic - use. To further enhance the pagination feature on this website to make it responsive to media sizes and more usable, I’ve decided to focus on this area and build my own pagination. I’ve found a great YouTube video that will help me achieve this.</p>

<p>In the next couple of days, I will follow this video step by step to build a pagination that’s functional and responsive. I will then utilise what I learned to enhance this website.</p>

I"5<p>It’s been at least two weeks since I created an account on Instagram, which was immediately banned by the platform. I’ve sent at least three appeals to request for the reinstation of the arbitrarily disabled account.</p>

<p>Most email communications were not followed, and the account remains blocked at the time of this writing. I received a message from the Instagram team last week claiming that the photo they asked me to send over was inadequate for them to confirm my identity.</p>

<p>First of all, I just created the account, so there’s no way that they can confirm I’m the account owner with my photo and hand-written note because I didn’t get a chance to access and use the account. This account is pretty much blank.</p>

<p>Also, it’s unreasonable for Instagram to request this photo as part of the process to have a mistakenly disabled account reinstated. A facial image and hand-written note can reveal a lot of information of a person. It’s no secret that Meta has been doing research on AI which includes facial recognition and other technologies that can threaten users’ privacy and security on and offline.</p>

<p>In fact, Meta has been heavily scrutinised and fined for opaque data acquisition rules. It would be no surprise that Meta’s Instagram is keeping all these images for purposes other than confirming the identity of an account owner considering that there isn’t footprint on the account.</p>

<p>As such, I have determined that this mandatory submission of personal facial images is a coersion that Meta is conducting in sharp contrast of users’ interests, privacy and security.</p>

<p>I will continue to actively approach the Instagram team to get my account back and have it deleted permenantly so that my email address and other critical data are not exposed to the thugs at Meta.</p>

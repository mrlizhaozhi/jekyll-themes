I"ø<p>Patriotism is a virtue that every responsible citizen should seek and uphold. Patriots support their countries by purchasing goods and services produced in their countries, joining the public service sector or the military, and rejecting foreign aggressions that undermine the interests of their countries. When it comes to cross-border friendships; however, we need a carefully measured approach to fulfill our patriotic duties.
<br /><br />
Let me be clear: patriotism remains important at all time. But when you have friends from other countries who may have gone through a completely different value education or whose countries may have interest conflicts with your country, you need to be mindful about the impact on your friendship of your patriotism.
<br /><br />
I‚Äôm a People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC) citizen. The PRC is the largest Socialist country in the world and considered a strategic competitor of the United States of America (United States). In the past four years, I pursued my bachelor‚Äôs degree in the United States and made some U.S. friends during that time. I have a good friend from Chicago who considers himself a conservative American. Those who‚Äôve been paying attention to the news can see American Conservatives are largely against virtually everything about the PRC simply because it has a polar opposite ideology. 
<br /><br />
Indeed, my Chicago friend agreed with almost every single policy in Trump‚Äôs strategy towards the PRC while I utterly disagreed with every single PRC-related policy in Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù foreign policy framework. Like many Chinese patriots, I support my country through buying and promoting Made in China, publicly reject Western propaganda that seeks to defame China but not only the Communist Party in Beijing, and even cut ties with some American students who‚Äôre radically conservative.
<br /><br />
However, my patriotism, which is right and needed, has put pressure on our friendship because we represented different ideals, interests, and peoples. This‚Äôs exactly why we need to be cautious when we demonstrate our patriotism in cross-border frienships. I‚Äôve indeed lost some friends because of my patriotism. I wouldn‚Äôt say I regret it, but that‚Äôs certainly not what I want as a result of fulfilling my patriotic responsibilities.
<br /><br />
I need to change my patriotic image so that I can fulfill my responsibilities as a citizen without hurting my cross-border friendships. It‚Äôs much better and less radical to focus on presenting and promoting the strengths of my country than hitting straight back at the pain points on which I have polar opposite opinions from my friends.
<br /><br />
I should talk about the convenient transportation system and infrastructure of the PRC rather than the battle between Socialism and Capitalism or atheism and theism. I must avoid bringing up the conflicts between the PRC and United States in front of my U.S. friends but take real actions to help my country grow better and stronger until it defeats all its enemies.
<br /><br />
It‚Äôs more patriotic to act to address your country‚Äôs problems than simply talking about it and letting this type of conversation ruin your cross-border relationships.

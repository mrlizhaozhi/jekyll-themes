		<p>I strive to be a mission-driven person. The sense of mission is critical to me. This mission
		shapes the person who I'm and my everyday behaviours. Being mission-driven means aligning 
		everything I do as well as how I do with the mission.</p>

		<p>As I continue to learn, grow and mature, my mission evolves. Right now, in Year 2022, my mission
		is to develop and apply business acumen, technical expertise, and artistic senses to create value
		in financial services.</p>

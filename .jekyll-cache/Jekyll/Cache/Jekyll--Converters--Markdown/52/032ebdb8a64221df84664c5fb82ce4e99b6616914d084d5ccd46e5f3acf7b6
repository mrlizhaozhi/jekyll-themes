I"^<p>I’ve been on a soul-finding mission since last year after joining the workforce. This search is critical. It will determine who I aspire to be and what steps I need to take to get there.</p>

<p>Art and design have been my passion since at a young age. Art has been one of my favourite courses since grade one. I love using art to express, communicate and envision. I joined the art club in college to meet people who also find their passions in this amazing field. I can achieve a lot more in paintings than I can do in the real world.</p>

<p>Given my unwavering passions for art and design, I have decided to pick it up from where I left off. To save trees and preserve our environment, I have decided to focus on digital art. Since I have a low budget, I have gathered a list of free and open-source software for making art on a computer. I have included them all on the <a href="/resources">resources</a> page. Check them out at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>In addition to these software programs, I have ordered a sketch pad on JD.com, which will arrive tomorrow. I will update you how I progress on this journey once I receive all the equipment. Spoiler alert, I’m considering launching an Art and Design Studio. The homepage of the studio will become available at <a href="/art-and-design">here</a> on this website. Stay tunned for more exciting news!</p>

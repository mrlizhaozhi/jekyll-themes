I"c<p>In the next two days, I will achieve a big milestone - finishing the eleven chapters in Part I of Python Crash Course on programming basics – Hooray! But before I celebrate this accomplishment, I want to step back and reflect critically on my learning path.</p>

<p>Knowledge and skills are different. They’re intertwined and equally important. This is why I’ve been separating the two to emphasise that I must acquire both to truly grasp the fundamentals of web development, data science and artificial intelligence. So far, I’ve been investing heavily in acquiring skills but not so much in acquiring knowledge.</p>

<p>I’ve been learning Python, R, Power BI and other tools essential to data science. It’s true that these are critical to success in a data-centric career; however, they’re not everything that matter. To succeed in a data career, I must also grasp the fundamentals of statistics and mathematics as well as computer science. This set of knowledge will form the basis for further advancement. Without the support of knowledge, skills can hardly be applied in the most effective way. Hence, I must return to the basics and invest more time and resources in acquiring the knowledge underpinning the web, analytics and AI.</p>

<p>To help facilitate this transition from laser focus on skills to equivalent emphasis on both knowledge and skills, I will roll out an action plan. This plan will ensure that I make reasonable progress on acquisition of both knowledge and skills so that I have the understanding of theories needed to apply my skills in the right way and support my research activities.</p>

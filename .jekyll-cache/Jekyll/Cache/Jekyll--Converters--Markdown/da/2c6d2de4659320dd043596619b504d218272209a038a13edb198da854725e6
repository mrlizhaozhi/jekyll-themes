The freedoms of speech and information are fundamental rights entitled to every human being. When these freedoms and rights are under pressure, we must take bold actions
to protect and preserve them.
<br /><br />
Robust debates and access to the free flow of information enable us to make progress together and build up stronger societies. We can't afford to allow any individual, 
business, organisation or government to gain advantage from asymetric information access.
<br /><br />
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has a long history of depriving the Chinese people of access to critical information that is viewed unfavourably by the party-state. We
as human beings need to see this fact and act to protect our interests and rights from the harm of information access denial.
<br /><br />
Here, I recommend two useful virtual private network (VPN) applications for getting what has been taken from us by the CCP government for a long time. A VPN allows people
to bypass the notorious Great Fire Wall on the Chinese internet to gain access to applications and websites containing information that is blocked within the Chinese border.
<br /><br />
The first one is CyberGhost. Its Firefox extension is free for everyone. I recommend installing Firefox, making it your default browser and adding this extension to gain broader
internet access from the Chinese mainland.
<br /><br />
DewVPN is an independent VPN application that you can install on your machine. Unlike a browser extension, all apps on your machine will be connected to the VPN service. You 
can download CCP-blocked apps such as Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp on your machine.
<br /><br />
By installing these software applications on your machines, you're helping to send a clear message to the CCP and malign actors that seek to harm instead of serving the interests
of people. You're standing up against the unjust and unwanted restrictions imposed on you and the people who you care about.

I"å<p>Tomorrow, 5th February 2022, we will conclude this enjoyable family reunion trip to Guilin and return to Guangzhou.</p>

<p>In the past three days, we had dinners with family members based in Guilin, watched the CCTV Chinese New Year Gala, and travelled to the Elephant Hill and countryside. This trip is fruitful as expected.</p>

<p>2022 is the Year of the Tiger. Tiger is known for its power. It represents success and all the positive things. I wish 2022 to be a great year for everyone.</p>

<p>Today marks the official launch of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The opening ceremony was broadcasted on domestic and foreign media. Whilst I didnâ€™t get the chance to watch the event live because we had a delicious meal away from home, I will certainly watch the replay and cheer up Team China.</p>

<p>This Spring Festival break is different in a few ways. This is the first Chinese New Year I get to celeberate in person with my family since 2017; this is the first Chinese New Year that I celebrate as an adult and business professional instead of a child or student; and, this is the first Chinese New Year that I pack and distribute red envelopes, etc.</p>

<p>Thisâ€™s also the first year that I didnâ€™t get to celebrate with my aunt, uncle, and consin from my fatherâ€™s side due to the passing of my consinâ€™s grandmother. I offer my sincere condolences to her and everyone in this family. I hope that we will reunite next year and wish everyone a healthy year to come.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I and my parents will travel back to Guangzhou. It will be another long day on roads. I look forward to starting my second rotation as business analyst at HSBC and returning to Guilin on the 2022 Chinese National Day and during the 2023 Spring Festival.</p>

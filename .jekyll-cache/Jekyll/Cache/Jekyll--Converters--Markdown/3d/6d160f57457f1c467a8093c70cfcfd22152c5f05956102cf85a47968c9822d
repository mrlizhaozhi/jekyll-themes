<p>You probably have heard of it many times that communication is the answer to most problems in a collaborative environment. As an information systems student, I learned this through projects in a hard way. I believe successes and failures all deserve reflections. They should be openly discussed. In this article, I want to share my thoughts on communication based on my project experience.
<br /> <br />
In the summer of 2020, I agreed to help a friend who had little to no web development experience to build a website for a client based in Atherton, California. I agreed to do so for two reasons ‚Äì first, he was my best friend at that time; and second, I wanted to put my coding skills into practice. With COVID-19 spreading rapidly across the states in the summer, we collaborated on Teams throughout the process.
<br /> <br />
Obviously, I learned a lot from that project, but I want to concentrate on communication in this article because we had some serious communication-related issues. I learned three lessons.
<br /> <br />
<b>Lesson 1: Make a plan but expect it to run off tracks </b>
<br /><br />
Every project requires a plan for team members to work closely and keep moving forward. However, it is critical to expect that things may not go as planned, which is usually the case.</p>

<p>As the only team member with the necessary technical competencies, I played a pivotal role that essentially managed all aspects of the website. While I was assigned to build back-end applications to collect and analyze data, I was forced to write some front-end code as well because my friend was still learning to code, and he made quite a lot of mistakes‚Ä¶usually the same ones.</p>

<p>I was frustrated because that was not how we planned. I got to work extra hours but received the same paycheck. I reflected on what happened. It is true that things fell apart, but ‚Äì Is it a surprise that as the only technician on the team I got to work longer hours? Is it my friend‚Äôs fault to have repeated the same mistakes as a beginner in web development? The answers are no. So, what went wrong?</p>

<p>Nothing went wrong but communication. Instead of bringing up our feelings on team meetings, we chose to keep them to ourselves, which did not help remove negativities but helped them grow. Eventually, they exploded and adversely impacted the team‚Äôs progress.</p>

<p>We ended up blaming each other based our own perspectives ‚Äì I complained about how he repeated those mistakes based on the assumption that we should follow the plan, and he is able to pick up front-end skills as quickly as I did, and he blamed me for not offering enough help based on the assumption that just because I am more technically capable, he could leave all those code issues for me to fix. That is not how things should have worked.</p>

<p>Instead of keeping these negativities to ourselves, we should have openly discussed them. The only way to fix these issues is communication. We were not supposed to keep those feelings private because of the fear that these negativities may ruin the cooperation. In fact, those issues are part of our cooperation. If I face this issue again, I will bring it up as soon as possible so it does not stick with the team.</p>

<p><b>Lesson 2: Always communicate with the goal of fixing problems instead of just throwing out personal feelings</b></p>

<p>We oftentimes draw an equal sign between communication and expression, but from my perspective, that is not the case. We want to express our feelings through communication, but communication should not stop there. We must understand that other people are not trash cans for holding negativities. When we have concerns, we should raise them up and fix them. The goal of communication should always be fixing problems instead of shooting negativities at others.</p>

<p>I learned this from the project as well. When the negativities exploded, we started badmouthing. I labeled him as a web rookie and blamed me as a loose cannon. We expressed our feelings, but there was no sincere and constructive communication. We did not realize it for a while, and those blame games solved no issues at all.</p>

<p>In hindsight, we could have done much better by expressing our feelings, expecting others would not immediately accept those perspectives, and trying to fix the issues and stop them for good through constructive communication. Communication goes beyond expression to address issues.</p>

<p><b>Lesson 3: Expect to communicate multiple times</b></p>

<p>Communication is a lasting process. We should not expect to solve problems with only one or two chats. Instead, we should expect to communicate repeatedly. While this sounds annoying, it is necessary.</p>

<p>This is the third lesson I learned from that project. We are not controllers of other people‚Äôs minds, so we should expect the result of communication to be different from what we expected. While our goal is to deliver the favorable result, it may not come with first few rounds of communication.</p>

<p>It is crucial to understand problem solving does not require imposition of one-sided perspectives. It is an exchange process because every person on the team is unique and has something different from yours. When you communicate, make sure that the goal is to solve issues, not necessarily persuading others to buy in your opinions.</p>

<p>I think these lessons are helpful for me and for you all as well. This is the reason I decide to publish this article on my person website‚Äôs blog channel. You can read my other articles as well. I hope you enjoy this content. If you‚Äôre interested, you can visit https://www.christine4council2020.com/. This is the website we helped to build.</p>

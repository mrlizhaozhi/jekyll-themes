I"ê	<p>Yesterday, I turned on the Creator Mode on LinkedIn - a feature that adds a Follow button on your LinkedIn profile to allow other LinkedIn users to follow your content with or without sending a friend request.</p>

<p>When you approve a connection request, LinkedIn automatically establishes a follower-ship between you and the person, unless this follower-ship is manually disabled by one side or both. I have 219 connections on LinkedIn, which means by default there should be 219 followers.</p>

<p>When the Creator Mode is on, you can see the number of followers against the number of connections. It shows I have 210 followers but 219 connections, which means 9 connections unfollowed me since we friended on LinkedIn. LinkedIn wonâ€™t notify you when a connection unfollows or even disconnects from you.</p>

<p>With this surprising finding, I searched all over the Web to see if thereâ€™s a solution to find out who these nine are. Whilst there are many people looking for such feature, and LinkedIn allows the export of certain data, thereâ€™s no readily available method to find out the people who unfollowed or unfriended on LinkedIn, so I decided to put my web scraping skill into practice.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m proficient in Python programming and the BeautifulSoup web scraping library, which enables the extraction of data from HTML web pages. Since LinkedIn requires login, and I have yet to learn how to deal with websites that require sign-ins, so I decided to download web pages and save them in a local folder so that I can work with the files.</p>

<p>I fired up Jupyter Notebook, imported BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and other required modules, and started working on this project. It didnâ€™t take long for me to extract all the followers and connections from the downloaded pages from LinkedIn. Surprisingly, the number of followers based on my analysis was 218 instead of 210! That means the numbers shown on LinkedIn are incorrect, there was only one connection rather than nine that unfollowed me as a first degree connection. It didnâ€™t take long for me to narrow down to that person.</p>

<p>With the evidence at hand, I submitted a case to LinkedIn. I have yet to receive a response from the company, but Iâ€™m certain that thereâ€™s something not adding up here. Once confirmed, I will make an update on this website and publish my solution so that more people â€“ both technical and non-technical â€“ will be able to find out the people who secretly unfollowed them on LinkedIn or other social media platforms.</p>
